          <title>Adding missing functionality from Rebol2</title>

            <p>At present Rebol 2 is stuck in the past with no prospect of fixes, but there is no product currently available that is able to replace it.  This makes updating an old Rebol 2 application such as Synapse EHR challenging.  Although Atronix Rebol3 has R3GUI, the kernel of their Rebol is old comparatively speaking and is mainly rebol3 alpha.</p>
<p>So, hopefully here comes zeromq to the rescue.  This script <a href="https://github.com/gchiu/r2-zeromq/blob/master/graham/taskventsink.r2" rel="nofollow noopener">taskventsink.r2</a> creates jobs which it sends to 0MQ.  We have another script - <a href="https://github.com/gchiu/r2-zeromq/blob/master/graham/zmqwork.8th" rel="nofollow noopener">zmqwork.8th</a>, and for testing, this is written in 8th, which polls 0MQ for jobs, and then sends the results back to 0MQ where they are then picked up by the first script.</p>
<p>Hopefully this means I'll be able to offload time consuming tasks to another program in an asynchronous fashion so that the Rebol2 VID is stable and able to respond, as well as access web services that use TLS 1.2 which are not accessible to Rebol 2.</p>
<p>I need to add GUIs for both the rebol 2 and 8th scripts to confirm the GUIs don't block.</p>
<p>Why didn't I use r3 for the worker? Because r3/hf lacks a working 0mq extension and GUI, and r3/a athough it has a GUI and 0MQ, it's too buggy.</p>
