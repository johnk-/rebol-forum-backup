            <p>It looks like we need to move from Stackoverflow <a href="https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/291/rebol" rel="nofollow noopener">chat</a> so it seems time to build our own chat client and server.</p>
<p>We have history on our sides with IOS messenger, and then Altme.  These provide the design base on which we can build.</p>
<p>I suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decentralised store like Altme</li>
<li>The ability to easily switch servers (need a central store somewhere)</li>
<li>Encrypted private messaging</li>
<li>Local store in a sqlite db</li>
<li>App is a PWA using WASM.</li>
<li>The ability for P2P direct messenging to avoid storing PMs anywhere</li>
<li>We'll need to store public certificates</li>
</ul>
<p>And other stuff</p>

            <p>Hey Guys,</p>
<p>I am coming out of hiding <img src="//forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=7" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  I had some family obligations come up last year, but these are all at manageable levels now. I appreciate <a class="mention" href="/u/blackattr">@BlackATTR</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/hostilefork">@hostilefork</a> for keeping in touch, and I see you guys have a launch coming up this year. Exciting times! <img src="//forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/partying_face.png?v=7" title=":partying_face:" class="emoji" alt=":partying_face:"></p>
<p>How can I help? I remember we had a lot of outstanding decisions to be made for the website, the last time we talked. What is the top priority at the moment?</p>
<p>I got a chance to try out Rebol in the browser, and that is just awesome, nice work!</p>

          <title>Operator meaning &quot;complete fully&quot;...what is that?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[hostilefork]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Wish List</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I'd like something to help notice when an operation did not consume all its input.</p>
<p>Something along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; (completely-consume add 1 2)
== 3

&gt;&gt; (completely-consume add 1 2 3)
** Error: ADD did not completely consume args, leftover is [3]
</code></pre>
<p>I've wanted such a thing for a while, but it's especially pressing now.  The API is getting more solid, so it's tempting to use it for doing things like calling from C the "System helpers written in Rebol"... a.k.a. what's in SYS.  But the existing mechanisms for doing that have a "no leftovers" flag, something like:</p>
<pre><code>DECLARE_LOCAL (result);
bool leftovers = false;
if (Apply_Throws(result, add_function, leftovers, arg1, arg2, arg3, rebEND))
    fail (Error_No_Catch_For_Throw(result));
</code></pre>
<p>I don't want such flags in the API.  It seems useful to have a generic operator.</p>
<p>In the past, I've tried "double-bar", because it would allow for a more forceful kind of separation than just a single bar.  Unfortunately, it has to be prefix...as there's no way at present in usermode to know the left hand side completed exactly one expression:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; (x: add 1 2 "foo" | print x)
3

&gt;&gt; (|| x: add 1 2 "foo" || print x)
** Error: extra stuff (["foo"])
</code></pre>
<p>I'm wondering if the idea of <code>||</code> is sound, but just needs a new piece of machinery.  Because this seems superior for the intent:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; (x: add 1 2 "foo" || print x)
** Error: extra stuff ["foo"]

&gt;&gt; (x: add 1 2 || "foo" print x)
** Error: extra stuff [print x]

&gt;&gt; (x: add 1 2 || print x "foo")
** Error: extra stuff ["foo"]

&gt;&gt; (x: add 1 2 || print x)
3
</code></pre>
<p>So what do people think?  Better ideas for the prefix operator?  Time for a new parameter marker, e.g. <code>&lt;solo&gt;</code>?</p>
<p>This <em>might</em> be something that could be a use for the debated "variadic left enfix".  Maybe it could be possible to take a value from the left, and then tell you if you were at the "tail" or not...while not actually being able to give you more than one value?  They're lost to history, but it wouldn't be hard to keep just a bit's worth of memory for this purpose.</p>
<p>As an API client it would be up to you to put it at the beginning or the end (or both?)</p>
<pre><code>REBVAL *v = rebRun("||", whatever, ..., ...);

REBVAL *v = rebRun("whatever", ..., ..., "||");</code></pre>

          <title>Adding missing functionality from Rebol2</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[gchiu]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Synapse EHR</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>At present Rebol 2 is stuck in the past with no prospect of fixes, but there is no product currently available that is able to replace it.  This makes updating an old Rebol 2 application such as Synapse EHR challenging.  Although Atronix Rebol3 has R3GUI, the kernel of their Rebol is old comparatively speaking and is mainly rebol3 alpha.</p>
<p>So, hopefully here comes zeromq to the rescue.  This script <a href="https://github.com/gchiu/r2-zeromq/blob/master/graham/taskventsink.r2" rel="nofollow noopener">taskventsink.r2</a> creates jobs which it sends to 0MQ.  We have another script - <a href="https://github.com/gchiu/r2-zeromq/blob/master/graham/zmqwork.8th" rel="nofollow noopener">zmqwork.8th</a>, and for testing, this is written in 8th, which polls 0MQ for jobs, and then sends the results back to 0MQ where they are then picked up by the first script.</p>
<p>Hopefully this means I'll be able to offload time consuming tasks to another program in an asynchronous fashion so that the Rebol2 VID is stable and able to respond, as well as access web services that use TLS 1.2 which are not accessible to Rebol 2.</p>
<p>I need to add GUIs for both the rebol 2 and 8th scripts to confirm the GUIs don't block.</p>
<p>Why didn't I use r3 for the worker? Because r3/hf lacks a working 0mq extension and GUI, and r3/a athough it has a GUI and 0MQ, it's too buggy.</p>

          <title>MATCH dialect (name conflict with Ren-C)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[hostilefork]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Quartermaster</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Ren-C's MATCH is a <a href="https://trello.com/c/LR9PzUS3/125-match-filters-values-based-on-type-tests-or-arbitrary-function-filters" rel="nofollow noopener">powerful variadic filtering function</a> for values, which can even let you just call the filter function on an argument while extracting that argument as the result:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; match parse "aaa" [some "a"]
== "aaa" ;-- whoa! how'd it do that? &gt;:-)
</code></pre>
<p>In any case, that name conflicts with MATCH in QuarterMaster, which is different:</p>
<pre><code>match ["three" two 1] [
    one: integer!
    two: opt 'two
    three: some string!
    four: any issue!
]
== make object! [
    one: 1
    two: 'two
    three: ["three"]
    four: _ ;-- e.g. none
]
</code></pre>
<p>This seems <a href="https://github.com/revault/rebol-wiki/wiki/Delect" rel="nofollow noopener">a lot like DELECT</a>, which was discussed recently.  I'd be interested to understand the differences, and if the two could be merged.  If so, I think it would probably be good to change the name to not conflict with Ren-C's MATCH, because that is something I think people are really going to want to use (once they realize how great it is!)  <img src="//forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=7" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/rgchris">@rgchris</a> mentions that Quartermaster has several dialect pieces ("parts").  I imagine each one probably warrants its own topic, at minimum.  Talking about the generality of it, maybe looking over the Rebol2 source and thinking about what Ren-C brings to the table for it.</p>

<p>Try switching the version (in the top-left corner where it says "Archived") and you can see how the Documentation section is able to seamlessly switch between the two different looks, and also have two different types of content.</p>
<p>So this is working pretty nicely, but I have run into a lot of questions (and potential issues) too ...</p>
<h3>Do you like the retro look?</h3>
<p>I am having a hard-time deciding if it is really, really bad or really, really good <img src="//forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/rofl.png?v=7" title=":rofl:" class="emoji" alt=":rofl:"></p>
<p>It's sort of a mashup of <a class="mention" href="/u/rgchris">@rgchris</a> <a href="http://scripts.rebol.info" rel="nofollow noopener">site</a> and Rebol Desktop. However, I think I took it too literally and got stuck in the 90's. Then again, maybe the retro feel is tugging at your heart strings. Turn on some Cobain and then let me know what you think!</p>
<h3>Should the script use different Prettify highlighting?</h3>
<p>I think it's clashing a bit with the rest of the archived page. Using the colors <a class="mention" href="/u/rgchris">@rgchris</a> used on his site would look better (assuming we want to keep the page's color scheme, or some variation of it). But then again, I wasn't sure if we wanted to keep all code examples looking the same on the site (regardless of if it was archived or not). Any opinions on this?</p>
<h3>Do we have the rights to use the old Rebol logo and/or Rebol Desktop icons?</h3>
<p>I'm guessing we don't, but I thought I would ask. If we don't, then what other logo would we use?</p>
<h3>Do we need to keep all old links?</h3>
<p>I got the following links redirecting properly ...</p>
<ul>
<li>View Script - <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/view-script.r?script=form-date.r" rel="nofollow noopener">http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/view-script.r?script=form-date.r</a>
</li>
<li>View Documentation - <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/documentation.r?script=form-date.r" rel="nofollow noopener">http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/documentation.r?script=form-date.r</a>
</li>
<li>Download Script - <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/download-a-script.r?script-name=form-date.r" rel="nofollow noopener">http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/download-a-script.r?script-name=form-date.r</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, I noticed there are a lot more links in the old Script Library. For example ...</p>
<ul>
<li>History - <a href="http://www.rebol.org/script-history.r?script-name=form-date.r" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rebol.org/script-history.r?script-name=form-date.r</a>
</li>
<li>License - <a href="http://www.rebol.org/license-help.r?script-name=form-date.r" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rebol.org/license-help.r?script-name=form-date.r</a>
</li>
<li>Download Doc as HTML - <a href="http://www.rebol.org/doc-download.r?script-name=form-date.r&amp;format=html" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rebol.org/doc-download.r?script-name=form-date.r&amp;format=html</a>
</li>
<li>Download Doc as Editable Plain - <a href="http://www.rebol.org/doc-download.r?script-name=form-date.r&amp;format=plain" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rebol.org/doc-download.r?script-name=form-date.r&amp;format=plain</a>
</li>
<li>Other Scripts by Author - <a href="http://www.rebol.org/cpt-list-scripts.r?user-name=chrisrg" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rebol.org/cpt-list-scripts.r?user-name=chrisrg</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do they all need to keep working? I think some of these are going to be challenging, if not impossible, to get working on a static Github site.</p>
<p>What about the links on the rest of the <a href="http://www.rebol.org" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.rebol.org</a> site (i.e. AltME, Mail List, Articles, Search, etc)? If we take over the domain one day, are all these links expected to keep working? This would be possible if we had control over the web server, but it is not possible on Github... which leads me to my next question.</p>
<h3>Are you okay with JavaScript redirects?</h3>
<p>A static Github site can not use HTTP redirects, i.e. it cannot send back a 301, 302 or 303 header to the client. I had to get those redirects working by using a "meta refresh" tag, which means all redirects are sending back a 200 OK. It works, but it's not really the way they should be done. Also, on top of that, these old links have parameters that identify the script to load up (e.g. ?script=form-date.r), and the only way to parse that on a static site is by using JavaScript.</p>
<p>The page loads, I use JavaScript to grab the name of the script, and then using JavaScript again, I write the "meta refresh" tag to the HTML, and this tells the browser to send me to the correct /docs/archived/scripts/ page. So this solution will work, but only with a browser, because it has the ability to run JavaScript. If a HTTP cURL client or Rebol script was loading the page, it would not get redirected properly.</p>

            <p>I have added the <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/roadmap" rel="nofollow noopener">Roadmap</a> mockup now, and I was wondering if you like the design and layout of the page? You will need to view it on a desktop / laptop screen. It doesn't display nicely on mobile right now, but that can always be fixed. I just wanted to get some first impressions before I spent more time on it.</p>
<p>Also, I understand you may not want to list dates here, and so they could be removed. And instead of displaying the year in the circle, it could be something like a checkbox icon, and it gets checked when a milestone has been reached.</p>
<p>Let me know your thoughts, thanks!</p>

          <title>Rebol.org Front Page Code Samples</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[hostilefork]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Community</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The very promising <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">prototype for rebol.org</a> has a current design where a blurb of text sits to the left of a panel of code on the right.  One can click buttons to get the code on the right to slide to some alternative examples.  The space currently used by the code is about 12 lines long, and about 45 characters wide.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/brianotto">@BrianOtto</a> picked a few random tidbits from things he had <em>(which included a use of COLLECT in PARSE, which is not at the moment in Ren-C, which is something we need to discuss/confront at some point)</em>.  But I've suggested that these samples should be punchy and well designed to demonstrate specific points about the language...and each time you switch to a new code sample, the text on the left would change to be some overview of what the sample is meant to demonstrate.</p>
<p>When the page first comes up, the left text should probably be broad and general...probably mostly capturing a "vision statement" of the overall project.  I'm not sure what code example would go best with that.  Maybe not a code example at all, but an animation of how easy to compile or install the project is.  Who knows?  Anyway, what's on the left and right when people first land on the page would have to be decided.</p>
<p>But assuming the page keeps its current form (vs moving to something like <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/~jps/animated_gifs_the_hard_way.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Sublime Text's PNG animation</a>), one might wonder what the text and samples should be as you page through them.  What are the points?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Code is Data</strong> - show BLOCK! restructuring/composition and execution via DO.</li>
<li>
<strong>No Keywords</strong> - can a brief example that isn't PARSE show how taking advantage of re-using IF or something is a powerful idea?  Is there an easy "killer" case that can show why this is good and not dangerous/bad?</li>
<li>
<strong>Natural Datatypes</strong> - some sort of quick gloss of <a href="http://www.rebol.com/rebolsteps.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Rebol in ten steps</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Freedom of Choice</strong> - perhaps show some quick contrasts of ways to write a statement... IF/ELSE vs. THEN vs. ALL OR vs EITHER.</li>
<li>
<strong>Evaluator Unchained</strong> - I'd personally like a punchy example of something like how + can be made to switch modes from infix to prefix, and how easy this is in userspace...so showing off enfix/variadics somehow.</li>
<li>
<strong>"Markdown of Programming"</strong> - Something about how the language has been agonized over to be pretty and not need IDEs or syntax highlighting, maybe even emphasize something like <code>--: function [...] [...]</code> to get a separator construct for <code>-- "Yes you can do this" --</code>.  Mention the fact that the code examples being black and white isn't an accident.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just to start the conversation, if people want to pick their favorite 40x12 matrix of code to show off.  So if you have an idea: what's the code, what's the bullet point and blurb to go with it?</p>
<p>One place to look for inspiration would be <a href="https://trello.com/b/l385BE7a/rebol3-porting-guide-ren-c-branch" rel="nofollow noopener">the Trello</a>.  What on there is "wow" for you?  Could that be condensed into a little box of "wow"?</p>
<p><em>Something to consider:</em> how to show output?  This isn't an interactive console session, so should it be just put in with comments?  This will take up space in the examples, so should be considered so people know what the code they're looking at <em>does</em>.</p>

            <p>If you view the <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/docs/3.0/insert" rel="nofollow noopener">Documentation</a> page on a mobile phone, you will see that the left-hand navigation appears at the top and you have to scroll through it to get to the content. Right now, it's not so bad, but as we add more sections I think that is going to get too long and be a pain to have to scroll through.</p>
<p>So we have two possible solutions... we could either display all sections collapsed when the site is viewed on mobile, or we could move the entire nav into the hamburger menu. For the latter, there could be a divider after the Download button and the documentation nav would display underneath it (and maybe there could be some kind of header or styling to make it clear that this is a sub-nav for the Documentation page).</p>
<p>Do you guys have a preference?</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I've mentioned that my concept of being "showy" for Rebol is to try and really make it about the code, and to stick to a near-typewriter aesthetic.  Here's a suggested starting theme modification for code samples:</p>
<pre><code>pre .str, code .str { color: #000000; } /* string  - black */
pre .kwd, code .kwd { color: #000000; } /* keyword - black */
pre .typ, code .typ { color: #000000; } /* type - black */
pre .lit, code .lit { color: #000000; } /* literal - black */
pre .pun, code .pun { color: #000000; } /* punctuation - black */
pre .pln, code .pln { color: #000000; } /* plaintext - black */
pre .tag, code .tag { color: #000000; } /* html/xml tag - black */
pre .atn, code .atn { color: #000000; } /* html/xml attribute name - black */
pre .atv, code .atv { color: #000000; } /* html/xml attribute value - black */
pre .dec, code .dec {
    font-weight: bold; color: #000000; /* dec (declaration?) - black and bold */
}
pre .com, code .com {
    color: #707080; font-style: italic; /* comment - gray ok if still dark */
}

pre.prettyprint, code.prettyprint {
	background-color: #FFFEFE; /* white or real close to white */
	-moz-border-radius: 8px;
	-webkit-border-radius: 8px;
	-o-border-radius: 8px;
	-ms-border-radius: 8px;
	-khtml-border-radius: 8px;
	border-radius: 8px;
}
</code></pre>
<p>I've mentioned some of the reasons why I believe this is the way to go--beyond my personal dislike of making one's code look like it has circus colors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In a language with no keywords, colorizing "keywords" does not make sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sticking to black and white helps show off the work done to try and reduce visual noise.  That message gets lost when you add...visual noise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The stated goal of the language is to be readable and editable without an IDE--and be pleasant to look at and work with in that state.  I think other principles (like sticking to 80 columns, however "archaic" that may sound) is a good guideline as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Matches the logo and the theme, lets color be used more strategically elsewhere on the site vs becoming something you have to "tune out".</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The one most critical thing to highlight, IMO, is the bolding of the SET-WORD!s and SET-PATH!s to further call them out...separating definitions and references.  I think that comments being a slightly-less-dark-shade, and maybe even italic, could be all right.</p>
<p>If this is generally accepted as the idea for the base theme (perhaps permitting a browser cookie or something to change themes if later ones are invented) then I think that helps when answering broad structure questions about contrast on the rest of the site, how to get balance of black and white regions, etc.</p>

</aside>
<p>We definitely want to make it easy and painless for people to give feedback to help improve the documentation.  I don't know that Disqus comments is the right way to go about it.</p>
<p><em>(I can't say I'm thrilled with Disqus in general.  Once <a href="http://blog.hostilefork.com/importing-comments-with-disqus-api/" rel="nofollow noopener">I integrated Disqus into my website</a>, and ultimately abandoned it.)</em></p>
<p>Comments that appear on-site, taking up page real estate, increasing javascript load time, and being potentially spammy probably aren't the best way to get feedback from people who aren't going to open a PR and edit themselves.  I'd probably prefer a button that goes to the GitHub issues for the documentation, maybe pre-filling it with some boilerplate?</p>
<p>e.g. <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/issues/new?title=Issue%20Title%20Here&amp;body=remark%20on%20http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/docs/3.0/insert" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/issues/new?title=Issue%20Title%20Here&amp;body=remark%20on%20http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/docs/3.0/insert</a></p>
<p>Though it would be nice perhaps if there were some way to be able to search GitHub for any open issues against a given documentation page, and have a link to that search available.  That would be a little like "browsing a comment section".</p>

            <p>The prototype <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">rebol.org</a> page features boxes for recent news.</p>
<p>Rather than launch with a completely empty news feed, I'm wondering if we want to take old commit announcements of features and put them in the chronology.</p>
<p>We've already done a "filling in" of the <a href="https://github.com/rebol/rebol-issues/issues?page=68&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen" rel="nofollow noopener">bugs in rebol-issues</a>, keeping them accurate with the CureCode dates.  It helps people get an understanding that there has been a history, as opposed to Rebol just popping out of nowhere.  We could combine the announcements from a GitHub commit with some stuff from a Trello to get an announcement.  For instance the <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/commit/fc7c536c66a87369b1384ebd02d80c3cb0468817" rel="nofollow noopener">HIJACK commit</a> from Jun 19, 2016 would suggest a news announcement at that time would be fitting.</p>
<p>Perhaps even adding some even older curated news items out of the old AltME announcements of notable historical things, to put the dates in context:</p>
<p><a href="http://rebol.info/altme/105/announce" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://rebol.info/altme/105/announce</a></p>
<p>...or important announcements from Carl's blog (if there's any issue with quoting the content in its entirety, a summary with a fair-use quote would do).  Things like the open sourcing announcement...just to fill out a timeline.</p>
<p>It might be easiest if those news items were just posts here on the forum in a category...which were transcluded to look like a news feed.  That would facilitate discussion as well as make edits easier, and fold in with a database that has to be running and backed up anyway.</p>

          <title>Rebol Docs Experiment</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[BrianOtto]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I did an interesting experiment with the <a href="https://github.com/gchiu/reboldocs" rel="nofollow noopener">Rebol Docs</a> repository today.</p>
<p>I forked it and in my copy I setup up the master branch to be the source for Github pages. This ended up giving me a <a href="http://brianotto.github.io/reboldocs" rel="nofollow noopener">http://brianotto.github.io/reboldocs</a> URL which I then mapped to a sub domain at <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com" rel="nofollow noopener">http://reboldocs.brianotto.com</a>.</p>
<p>I committed the website source I have been working on and then linked the Documentation section to one of the help Markdown files, i.e. <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/insert" rel="nofollow noopener">http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/insert</a> (which is really <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrianOtto/reboldocs/master/insert.MD" rel="nofollow noopener">insert.MD</a>), and Github now renders any Markdown I add there to HTML, automatically creating a documentation page for me. I had been working on some small code examples, before starting on the website, and so this what you see listed there.</p>
<p>So it appears like we could use the already existing MD files for two purposes, the interpreter help and the website documentation. One thing I did have to do was add HTML comments (i.e. &lt;!--) around the interpreter help section so the website wouldn't render them. Would it be easy to ignore these by the interpreter?</p>
<p>Anyway, this basically gives us the ability to have URLs named after any of the documents in that repository. Also, the content is controlled by Github, and so the repository can be forked and anyone can contribute using only a markdown editor and sending a PR. There is no need to install Jekyll or the likes.</p>
<p>However, there is still one issue I am looking into and that is the ability to maintain the website header and footer on each of the documentation pages and to have some kind of navigation display. I <em>think</em> you can create a template that all MD files get rendered in, but still looking into this ...</p>
<p>What do you think? Do you like this approach?</p>

            <p>I've got a rough estimate for updating TLS from Cyphre depending on what we need of $1500-2000.</p>
<p>I'll ask him to post to this thread what he wants to know.</p>
<p>Basically I think we need TLS 1.2 with ECDHE. Full server implementation also nice to have.</p>
<p>Eg. TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 (0xc030)</p>
<p>Please comment.</p>

            <p><strong>Is the ability to load external libraries considered a fundamental part of the core functionality of the language?</strong></p>
<p>On the face of it, I would suggest so—off the top of my head I could cite SQLite and ImageMagick as desirable components that, though they could be incorporated in other ways such as CALL, would more efficiently be utilized through the library interface.</p>
<p>The promise in Rebol 3 Alpha and Rebol 2 (specific implementation differing slightly) was thus:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sqlite: make library! %libsqlite3.dylib
sqlite-version: make-routine sqlite "sqlite3_libversion" [
    return: [string]
]
sqlite-version
</code></pre>
<p>This is nominally possible in Ren-C through the FFI extension (I say nominally as I have not been able to confirm this first hand and understand this is still a less than ideal approach).</p>
<p><strong>Or are extensions the prescribed way to achieve integration?</strong></p>
<p>Which would open up a whole bunch of other questions.</p>

            <p>We've talked at length for years about a foundation or committee of engaged Rebol users to help manage the Rebol assets including <a href="http://Rebol.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Rebol.org</a>, and any other domains that RT no longer wish to maintain.  I'd like this to extend to managing or help fund the new assets such as Rebol.info and Forum.rebol.info.</p>
<p>Yes, we'll need a charter and members, so if anyone has experience in these matters, let's discuss this one last time and actually get something done!</p>

            <p>We should be in a position to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/rebolfoundation" rel="nofollow noopener">accept donations</a> both for running of this forum, rebol.info and for specific tasks.</p>
<p>I was wondering how that might happen transparently.  <a class="mention" href="/u/blackattr">@BlackATTR</a> suggested using <a href="https://www.patreon.com/" rel="nofollow noopener">Patreon</a> so I wonder if that could be used to fund a Rebol Foundation which then dishes out funds for the ongoing maintenance of our intrastructure.  But I see that they take 5%.</p>
<p>What about a Bitcoin address that is held by the foundation, and just takes donations? Are the transactions at one address transparent?</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/gchiu">@gchiu</a>, the detail you have on the community board re. bringing ren-C to parity with Rebol2 could maybe be part of the porting guide Trello, no?</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/hostilefork">@hostilefork</a>, any opinion?</p>
