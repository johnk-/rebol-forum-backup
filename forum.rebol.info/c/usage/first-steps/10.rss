          <title>Understanding Definitional Scoping</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[DefinitionalUsername]]></dc:creator>
          <category>First Steps</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I just started learning Red/Rebol, and I was having trouble understanding the scoping rules. I did read the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/21964858" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rebol_Programming/Advanced/Bindology" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Bindology</a>, and I think I somewhat understand, but I'm not sure! I'd be grateful if someone can confirm the my deductions about the following code from the SE post:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">rebol []

a: 1

func-1: func [] [a]

inner: context [
    a: 2
    func-2: func [] [a]
    func-3: func [/local a] [a: 3 func-1]
]

reduce [func-1 inner/func-2 inner/func-3]
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Compile-time:</strong> First, when the code is compiled, a list of top-level names is created. <em>(<code>a</code>, <code>func-1</code>, <code>inner</code>)</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Load-time:</strong> When the code is loaded, context <strong>A</strong> is created with those symbols as members. Also, the entire code is walked through, and every occurrence of those symbols is bound to these entries. <em>(e.g., <code>a</code> inside <code>func-2</code> would be bound to the top-level <code>a</code>)</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Run-time:</strong> When <code>a: 1</code> is executed, the value <code>1</code> is stored in the <code>a</code>'s slot in the context.</li>
<li>The <code>func</code> keyword after <code>func-1:</code> creates a new function, and assigns it to <code>func-1</code>. However, it leaves the binding of <code>a</code> intact.</li>
<li>The <code>context</code> keyword after <code>inner:</code> creates a new context <strong>B</strong>, walks over all the block, collecting all new symbols, and inserts those in the new object.</li>
<li>
<code>a: 2</code> assigns value <code>2</code> in <code>a</code>'s slot in the new context.</li>
<li>
<code>func</code> after <code>func-2:</code> creates a function while keeping <code>a</code>'s new binding intact, and assigns it to <code>func-2</code>'s slot.</li>
<li>
<code>func</code> after <code>func-3:</code> creates a function and creates a new context <strong>C</strong> in which <code>a</code> is inserted and bound.</li>
<li>Upon execution of <code>reduce</code>, <code>func-1</code> returns <code>1</code> from context <strong>A</strong>, <code>func-2</code> return <code>2</code> from context <strong>B</strong>, and <code>func-3</code> executes <code>func-1</code> which returns <code>1</code> from context <strong>A</strong> again.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, now,  a few questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the above correct? If it is,</li>
<li>How does the <code>context</code> keyword determine which set-words it should create a slot for? i.e.,
<ul>
<li>if <code>a: 2</code> didn't exist, will it still create the slot for <code>a</code> due to <code>a: 3</code> deep inside?</li>
<li>What about if <code>a:3</code> didn't exist either? Will the new context contain a slot for <code>a</code> just due to <code>a</code> inside <code>func-2</code>'s body?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Did <code>context</code> bind <code>a</code> in <code>[/local a]</code> too, before <code>func</code> was executed?</li>
<li>When a new context is created, does it copy existing symbols or bindings from the older context? If not,</li>
<li>Is there a parent-child relationship between contexts, or are they free-standing? Given a context, can I chase some pointer to its parent or child?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry for so many questions, I think I am getting extra confused since I already have programming experience and need to unlearn some stuff before being able to grok Rebol.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

          <title>Building on VS 2019</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Brett]]></dc:creator>
          <category>First Steps</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Thought I'd have a look at the newest ren-c, but I tried and failed to build on VS 2019.  Wondering if builds with Visual Studio 2019 should be working or if that's on hold for now?</p>
<p>If it's on hold until a request, don't spend a lot of time trying to get it working for just me as my immediate interest and priority now is in end user business tools and integration for myself and my wife rather than language work per se. I.e web api's and <a href="http://vb.net">vb.net</a> because I need whip up things in languages I'm familiar with to get things done with little time.</p>
<p>What I did:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Copied r3-windows-x86-8994d23.exe to ./prebuilt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Installed VS C++ tools (clicked the box that looked right).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run a command file with the following:</p>
<p>call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"<br>
set R3_MAKE=C:\Projects\ren-c\prebuilt\r3-windows-x86-8994d23.exe<br>
"%R3_MAKE%" ../make.r config: ../configs/vs2019-x64.r debug: asserts optimize: 2</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What I got was:</p>
<pre><code>...
Dynamic extensions
** Script Error: generate has no value
** Where: switch for-each do catch either else _ do
** Near: [rebmake visual-studio ~~ generate (x86)]
** File: ../make.r
** Line: 871
</code></pre>
<p>Then I changed the line in make for the vs2019 target from:</p>
<pre><code>rebmake/visual-studio/generate/(x86) output-dir solution
</code></pre>
<p>to:</p>
<pre><code>rebmake/makefile/generate/(x86) output-dir solution
</code></pre>
<p>and got a different error, so then I thought I'd ask here, since I'm clueless about compiling with C, C++.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Perhaps this needs to be in a (sub)category of its own.</p>
<p>You know the feeling that you want to do something that looks really simple but how to do this in Rebol/Ren-C</p>
<p>Case:<br>
A. Transforming the content of a block into a string</p>
<p>B. Transforming the content of a string to become a block</p>
<p>First try:<br>
A.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; blk: [What becomes of a block when turned into a {} value?]
== [What becomes of a block when turned into a "" value?]
&gt;&gt; mold blk
== {[What becomes of a block when turned into a "" value?]}
</code></pre>
<p>B.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; txt: "What becomes of a string when turned into a [] value?"
== {What becomes of a string when turned into a [] value?}
&gt;&gt; to block! txt
== [{What becomes of a string when turned into a [] value?}]
</code></pre>
<p>So clearly not what was intended!</p>
<p>After some tinkering:<br>
A.</p>
<pre><code>block-to-text: function [blk [block!]][
    result: copy ""
    spacer: copy ""
    for-each b blk [
        append append result spacer mold b
        spacer: copy " "
    ]
    result
]
block-to-text blk
== {What becomes of a block when turned into a "" value?}
</code></pre>
<p>B.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; blk: load append append "[" txt "]"       
== [What becomes of a string when turned into a [] value?]
</code></pre>
<p>To be improved?</p>

          <title>Help Compiling Ren-C</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[TimeSlip]]></dc:creator>
          <category>First Steps</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>First of all, although somewhere in the back of my mind I heard about Ren-C, my programming time has been limited over the years and so I still mainly use R2 with some Red thrown in. I was working on some library stuff which led me to Nick's site which lead me to the Rebol 2019 videos. Holy Cow! Is this what you all have been up to?<br>
Anyway, I've been trying to compile the Ren-C R3 version (I'll put together a beginner's tutorial at some point) and I get these warnings several times during the compilation:<br>
In function 'rebJumps_inline':       prep\include/rebol.h:1040: warning: 'noreturn' function does return<br>
In function 'rebJumpsQ_inline':prep\include/rebol.h:1048: warning: 'noreturn' function does return</p>
<p>When the script appears to end I don't see any .exe file</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to proceed?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>

          <title>REBOL on embedded systems, STM32</title>

          <category>First Steps</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I am impressed with REBOL's lack of dependencies and reasonable use of resources. I am curious just how thin we can get the runtime library both with and without TinyC for use on the STM32 ARM Cortex-M MCU. A typical Cortex-M MCU may have between 64 to 2048 kB of internal flash memory and 32 to 1024 kB of RAM.</p>
<p>The Hello World of the embedded world is blinking LED and is called, affectionately, Blinky. It involves an element of timing and the writing of data to an output register (e.g. GPIOx-&gt;ODR for STM32).</p>
<p>I would like to try REBOL for this use case.</p>
<p>What would it take to give this a go on an embedded Cortex-M MCU?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Joe Gorse</p>

          <title>Make a Rebol: minimum viable rebol interpreters</title>

          <category>First Steps</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>What would it take for me to kick off this process and build a minimum viable rebol interpreter as a learning exercise?</p>
<p>I've recently been interested in the a <a href="https://github.com/kanaka/mal" rel="nofollow noopener">"make a lisp"</a> project as a powerful learning tool for both learning lisp and for learning other languages. Does anyone have any thoughts as to the feasibility of this for rebol?</p>
<p>I understand that having a good vetted implementation for doing "real work" like Ren-C or Red is important (keep the WASM build coming), but I'm coming to believe that some of the staying power of lisp is that in terms of choosing dependencies for long term projects something that you can build from scratch with dozens of examples is pretty good future proofing.</p>

<p>REBOL is a messaging language. Its main purpose is to provide<br>
a better approach to distributed computing and communication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can not refrain from making the connection with Erlang while thinking that the concept is quite different even if the intention is the same in the words. To see later.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>REBOL introduces the concept of dialecting</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dialecting is very interesting. I find this a paper, <a href="http://www.gkc.org.uk/martin/papers/middle-out-t.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">Language Oriented Programming</a> of M. P. Ward about it. Have to read it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>REBOL implementations are intentionally kept very small</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the aspect that I think keeps the whole very compact. I hope it's extensible, though.</p>

            <p>Since <a class="mention" href="/u/lkppo">@LkpPo</a> reported problems creating new threads, and <a class="mention" href="/u/gchiu">@gchiu</a> seems to be MIA the last 4 days on holiday, I thought I'd create a new thread to offer any building support.  This is generally done on StackOverflow, but we can do it here as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will try a build on OpenBSD, provided Iâ€™m migrating on this system instead of Debian.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We haven't done a bootstrap to a system we don't have binaries for in a while (!)</p>
<p>The idea is that there are some generated files, and to generate these files you need a working Rebol.  But what you can do is you can be on one machine and tell it to build a "prep" directory with all these files for another target machine.  Then you move that folder over and build with a C compiler, and get your executable.  Now you're bootstrapped: you can use that executable for any subsequent builds.</p>
<p>This hasn't happened since we went to an "all Rebol" build system.  The build system is big...Shixin wrote it and I think probably considered working on it as annoying as I would.  So it didn't really get documentation or peer review.  But on the upside, <em>it is all Rebol</em> - so you don't need GNU make or other tools installed.  And when we wrangle it to try and make it better we can use Rebol to do so...so it doesn't feel like as much a waste of time as fiddling with CMake/etc.  It provides experience that feeds back into improvement of the language, and a much-needed "big" test case.</p>
<h2>Debian is probably the best system to try <em>first</em>
</h2>
<p>You should be able to go to the %make/ directory and type:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>./r3-linux-x64-8994d23 make.r</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That will run a Ren-C executable <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/commit/8994d23" rel="nofollow noopener">built at commit 8994d23</a>.  There are various options you can use, here's an example of settings I use for development on Linux:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>./r3-linux-x64-8994d23 make.r config: configs/generic-c++.r optimize: 0 rigorous: true debug: sanitize standard: c++17 target: makefile static: yes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That generates a heavily instrumented build with Address Sanitizer, that runs slow but catches a lot of issues.  It uses C++ to build, which adds extra checks at compile-time, though is equivalent at runtime to the C build.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what your specific areas of interest or skills are, but reply to this thread if you need any help... or ideally, join StackOverflow and ask a couple of Q&amp;A there.  We can help upvote you to get chat privileges (it's very easy, only 20 points).</p>

            <p>Everybody is new to Rebol at some point. Whether you are struggling with the installation or you just can't figure out why you are not seeing the performance everybody else seems to be talking about.</p>
<p>To make helping you easy, explain what you are planning to do and how you are currently doing. Post some code (a minimal reproducible example).</p>
<p>A lot of questions have already been answered so make sure you searched this forum and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rebol+or+rebol2+or+rebol3+or+red" rel="nofollow noopener">StackOverflow's using Redbol tags</a> first.</p>
