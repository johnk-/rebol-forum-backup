            <p>Another idea I came up with that can become very useful for system administrators.<br>
To use some applications sometimes you need to establish some connections or a certain setup before they can be started or used.</p>
<p>So for instance to connect to a database a ssh tunnel must be initiated and the program perhaps must be started from a shell script.</p>
<p>Another program will work inside a virtual environment that must be 'activated' first and then a <code>cd</code> to the correct directory.</p>
<p>There could be several other tasks that require one or more terminal windows to be used that could be centralised and managed within Ren-C.</p>
<p>One (other) tool could monitor the status of the different facilities that were managed before.</p>

            <p>This should be an 'easy' project.<br>
Creating a little piece of backup software using Ren-C.</p>
<p>What should it be able to do?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Connect to a remote backup location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a password that will be stored encrypted after it is provided (or not stored and required for every use)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know which folders to backup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only backup the files that were changes since last backup on the chosen backup volume</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preferably have an incremental backup</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not primarily meant for backing up sourcecode, because git and other svn systems are taking that role already. It is for other documentation and stuff that hangs around on your computer and would be nice to recover after machine loss or transfer to a new one.</p>
