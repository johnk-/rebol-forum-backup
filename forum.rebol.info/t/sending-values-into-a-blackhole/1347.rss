    <title>Sending Values into a BLACKHOLE!</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/sending-values-into-a-blackhole/1347</link>
    <description>Multiple return values have an interesting angle to them: **the more values you request... the functionality you ask for might wind up being different**.

Consider TRANSCODE.  If you don&#39;t use multi-returns...or just ask for one return...you get the whole thing transcoded as a block:

    &gt;&gt; transcode &quot;&lt;abc&gt; &lt;def&gt;&quot;  ; plain behavior
    == [&lt;abc&gt; &lt;def&gt;]

    &gt;&gt; block: transcode &quot;&lt;abc&gt; &lt;def&gt;&quot;  ; set-word! (follows usual rules)
    == [&lt;abc&gt; &lt;def&gt;]

    &gt;&gt; [block]: transcode &quot;&lt;abc&gt; &lt;def&gt;&quot;  ; same behavior as `block:`, enforced
    == [&lt;abc&gt; &lt;def&gt;]

But if you supply it with a parameter in the second slot, it assumes you want /NEXT and will set that argument to the next position. 

    &gt;&gt; [value pos]: transcode &quot;&lt;abc&gt; &lt;def&gt;&quot;
    == &lt;abc&gt;

    &gt;&gt; pos
    == &quot; &lt;def&gt;&quot;

    &gt;&gt; value
    == &lt;abc&gt;

BLANK! gives you the ability to opt out of slots in the multiple return values that you don&#39;t want.  But opting out doesn&#39;t just keep you from having to name a variable, it also *un-requests the behavior*...

    &gt;&gt; [value _]: transcode &quot;&lt;abc&gt; &lt;def&gt;&quot;
    == [&lt;abc&gt; &lt;def&gt;]  ; not a /NEXT, it was &quot;revoked&quot;

What if you want to request the behavior, but not have to bother with creating a variable to store it in?  Well now that we are thinking **#** will be a shorthand for the immutable and not-appendable-to-strings &quot;codepoint 0&quot;, it&#39;s a perfect choice:

    &gt;&gt; [value #]: transcode &quot;&lt;abc&gt; &lt;def&gt;&quot;
    == &lt;abc&gt;  ; only the /NEXT item

The value was requested but disappeared...into a black hole.  In fact, BLACKHOLE! is now a datatype you can put in a spec to mean &quot;empty issue that is precisely `#`.  It&#39;s not validated yet (it&#39;s a synonym for ISSUE!...we&#39;ll need type constraints before it can work).  But it can help keep track of places that use this idea.  For instance, SET:

    &gt;&gt; set # 10
    == 10

The truthiness of # helps write code that distinguishes the wish to opt-out of a behavior from the wish to opt-out of getting its result.  Having SET error on blank helps you avoid calculations that may be unnecessary...so it works out perfectly:

     do-something: func [
         in
         /out [blank! word! path! blackhole!]
         &lt;local&gt; result
     ][
         process foo
          if bar [  ; unlike BLANK!, empty issue is truthy so branch runs
             result: process/more foo
             set bar result  ; blackhole SET is no-op (BLANK! would error)
          ]
     ]
