<p><strong>Note:</strong> People should bear in mind there was never a question that semicolon was going to stay a comment character.  <em>There was only a question of if another sequence (or sequences) would be permitted.  (!)</em></p>
<p>Also, bear in mind that the alternative syntax for comments discussion started in August 2017.  Hence it <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/issues-with-invisibles-a-truly-disappearing-comment/405">predated the creation of "invisibles" by about 4 months</a>.  Invisibles have offered a much higher leverage tool for machine-processable comment-like things, and to use them requires not giving up too many characters to be stripped out of source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ideas have been discussed and tried.  But the time has run out on this decision, and status quo wins.</p>
<h2>Semicolon will be the only scanner comment in Beta/One</h2>
<p>Other ideas got panned for various reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>#</code></strong> Makes every line look like it has an <span class="hashtag">#issue</span> on it, and # is overloaded as it is (char! should probably change to <strong>&amp;</strong> and be more compatible with HTML character entities).  The use of issues and having them stand out is a more unique Rebol attraction than comments.  Having lone # for a dialecting component seems nice, e.g. <code>compose # [(1 + 2) (# 1 + 2) (1 + 2)]</code> =&gt; <code>[(1 + 2) 3 (1 + 2)]</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>//</code></strong> Tried it for a while and it didn't make it as happy as I wanted it to.  Wound up desired for NewPath, as the representation of a length 3 path with blanks in it.  Having blanks in paths not render affords paths like <strong>/foo</strong> (what was a refinement) and <strong>foo/</strong> (previously did not exist).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>--</code></strong> Made up of a known legal WORD! character.  Have gotten kind of attached to this as a shorthand for DUMP-to-end-of-line.     Has uses in dialects, e.g. those representing command lines (it's a sequence used to indicate end of switches and beginning of parameters).  Doesn't look good when doing sequential lines of comments as a block, only when commenting an existing line rightwards...which means it's not a good "one size fits all" comment form like <code>//</code> is for C and C++.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>\</code></strong> Only <a class="mention" href="https://forum.rebol.info/u/gchiu">@gchiu</a> likes it.  Every time we try to talk about it, StackOverflow chat or other mediums with escaping throw a fit.  My experience with trying it out for generalized quoting instead of apostrophe made me fairly convinced I hate this character in source code.  I think I want to stick to <span class="mention">@MarkI</span>'s idea that it's the one ASCII codepoint we promise not to use outside of strings, to help people making templating languages <em>who need an escape from Rebol itself</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<p>My own conclusion is that I'm going to avoid the <code>;--</code> and <code>;;</code> sequences.  They don't help make up for semicolon's shortcomings, they exacerbate the problem and destroy what merit it does have.</p>
<p>Instead I suggest sticking to single semicolons, and finding a way to space them away from the code.  I personally wouldn't want to get in the business of doing alignment of semicolons to some arbitrary margin you have to maintain as you edit:</p>
<pre><code> some &lt;code&gt; on a #medium line       ; so I put comment here
 short line                          ; guess comment goes here, then?
 then =what= IF [I go write &lt;some&gt;] "Long line"    ; crap, touch all the lines now? 
</code></pre>
<p>This kind of practice annoys me in version control due to touching lines that shouldn't have been affected.  <em>(Of course, it's text and not a graph database, so you get this with secondary changes due to indentation too.)</em></p>
<p>Instead I'd just suggest trading off something like the two spaces you might have used for a dash before, and use them for an extra space to put some distance from your code.</p>
<pre><code> some &lt;code&gt; on a #medium line  ; comment two spaces out
 short line  ; again, just two spaces
 then =what= IF [I go write &lt;some&gt;] "Long line"  ; not perfect (but nothing is) 
</code></pre>
<p>Compare that with the alternative using another unit of character width, e.g. <code>;--</code>:</p>
<pre><code> some &lt;code&gt; on a #medium line ;-- this seems more cluttered
 short line ;-- at least, I think it looks cluttered 
 then =what= IF [I go write &lt;some&gt;] "Long line" ;-- but do whatever you like 
</code></pre>
<p>Then there's <code>;;</code>:</p>
<pre><code> some &lt;code&gt; on a #medium line ;; this is probably even worse
 short line ;; I've tried this one for a while and pretty sure I hate it 
 then =what= IF [I go write &lt;some&gt;] "Long line" ;; but well, matters of taste 
</code></pre>
<p>Embracing the single semicolon actually works pretty reasonably if you put comments on their own lines, when they line up like this their complained-about "dottedness" almost suggests a cut-along-dotted-line kind of separation:</p>
<pre><code> ; STUFF TO TALK ABOUT
 ;
 ; This isn't so bad...it's actually kind of nice
</code></pre>
<h2>Closing This and Looking to the Future</h2>
<p>I mentioned that we have invisibles now, and my attachment to <code>--</code> for DUMP has made me reluctant to take it away from dialecting.  And it's invisible, too...so very comment-like.</p>
<p>Perhaps its best to just repeat a mantra <a href="../deciding-on-an-alternative-comment-syntax/275/49%3Fu=hostilefork.html">like what @LkpPo said</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"...a comment do[es] nothing from the point of view of the computer. Why [have] more ways of doing nothing?"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Semicolon may kind of suck as a character, but that just means it's not wanted for anything else.  So it seems to have job protection/monopoly status.</p>
<p>The big change of taking <strong>==</strong> away from equality comparison and giving it back for marking up sections may open some doors to new and interesting forms of commenting that can actually <em>do</em> something (e.g. when you are in a debug mode, print out <strong>== PHASE ONE ==</strong> as it passes by).</p>
