    <title>Variadic Scanning in pure C First Example: *working*</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/variadic-scanning-in-pure-c-first-example-working/361</link>
    <description>I&#39;m happy to report that a bit of hacking led to a successful first test flight of fully C-standards compliant, variadic scanning.

Here&#39;s a quick sample native:

    //
    //  variadic-scan-test: native [
    //
    //  {Demo the routine powering the variadic scanner with 3 items}
    //
    //      item1
    //      item2
    //      item3
    //  ]
    //
    REBNATIVE(variadic_scan_test)
    {
        INCLUDE_PARAMS_OF_VARIADIC_SCAN_TEST;

        REBARR *result = Scan_Va_Managed(
            &quot;if not&quot;, ARG(item1), &quot;[\n&quot;,
                ARG(item2), &quot;| print {Close brace separate from content}\n&quot;,
            &quot;] else [\n&quot;,
                ARG(item3), &quot;| print {Close brace with content}]\n&quot;,
            END
        );
        Init_Block(D_OUT, result);
        return R_OUT;
    }

Invoking it actually worked on the first try, as intended:

    &gt;&gt; variadic-scan-test 1 {Two} [T h r e e]
    == [if not 1 [
        &quot;Two&quot; | print &quot;Close brace separate from content&quot;
    ] else [
        [T h r e e] | print &quot;Close brace with content&quot;
    ]]

Pretty nifty, huh?

If you&#39;re not concerned about the newlines (most **rebDo()** or whatever you call it would perhaps not be) then it could look a bit cleaner.  We could also consider some separate token for that so it didn&#39;t make the code as ugly.</description>
