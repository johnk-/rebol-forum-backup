    <title>The simple things matter the most</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/the-simple-things-matter-the-most/1428</link>
    <description>Perhaps this needs to be in a (sub)category of its own.

You know the feeling that you want to do something that looks really simple but how to do this in Rebol/Ren-C

Case:
A. Transforming the content of a block into a string

B. Transforming the content of a string to become a block

First try: 
A.

    &gt;&gt; blk: [What becomes of a block when turned into a {} value?]
    == [What becomes of a block when turned into a &quot;&quot; value?]
    &gt;&gt; mold blk
    == {[What becomes of a block when turned into a &quot;&quot; value?]}

 

B.

    &gt;&gt; txt: &quot;What becomes of a string when turned into a [] value?&quot;
    == {What becomes of a string when turned into a [] value?}
    &gt;&gt; to block! txt
    == [{What becomes of a string when turned into a [] value?}]
 
So clearly not what was intended!

After some tinkering:
A. 

    block-to-text: function [blk [block!]][
        result: copy &quot;&quot;
        spacer: copy &quot;&quot;
        for-each b blk [
            append append result spacer mold b
            spacer: copy &quot; &quot;
        ]
        result
    ]
    block-to-text blk
    == {What becomes of a block when turned into a &quot;&quot; value?}


B.

    &gt;&gt; blk: load append append &quot;[&quot; txt &quot;]&quot;       
    == [What becomes of a string when turned into a [] value?]

To be improved?</description>

</aside>
<p>I like the idea that the /ONLY be offered in a convenient way for those who disagree and want to get in a different habit.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; mold @[like so]
== "[like so]"

&gt;&gt; var: [in a variable]
&gt;&gt; mold @var
== [in a variable]

&gt;&gt; mold '@[subvert parameter mode detection]
== "@[subvert parameter mode detection]"
</code></pre>
<p>The single block "blockification" is an interesting idea but it has hitches that I ran into trying it, so I feel like /ONLY has a pretty strong gravity for this that might be sticking around...especially as it pertains to being switched on or off with @ as a shorthand for those who prefer shorthands.</p>

            <p>Right, this might be what you would want or expect, but if you expect that all in quotes is transformed into a block! then this trivial task is becoming a little more difficult.</p>

    I'm reminded of another thing I thought about which might help distinguish a TO from a MAKE.  That could be that you are assured that TO won't evaluate anything you pass in.  So if you said x: does [print "hi" 10] | to text! [x + 20], whatever did happen, it would not print out "hi" and come back as the text string "30". 
That would limit what to text! of a BLOCK! would be allowed to do, e.g. to things like MOLD or FORM (but not "REMOLD" &lt;gack!&gt; or "REFORM" &lt;gaaack!&gt;) 
As far as I know, there ar…

    When I gave this example, I was contrasting TEXT! and CHAR! conversions TO INTEGER!. 
I should have pointed out that ISSUE! is a more obvious dissonance:

That just looks wrong as-is.  But when #1 and #"1" are synonyms as immutable "issuechar!"/TOKEN! (as by all appearances they should be), there can't be a distinction. 
It may be that some other operator like as integer! fits into getting the codepoint.  But I mention codepoint of a…
