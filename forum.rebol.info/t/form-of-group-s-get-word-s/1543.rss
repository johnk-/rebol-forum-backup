    <title>FORM of GROUP!s, GET-WORD!s...</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/form-of-group-s-get-word-s/1543</link>
    <description>Trying to write shell code in Rebol, you notice that bash has a pretty strong advantage of putting together fragments of text with environment variables.

I think we&#39;d have a leg up if there were a behavior in something that didn&#39;t reduce strings--like FORM--if it would make an exception for GROUP!s.

Historically you get something pretty useless:

    rebol2&gt;&gt; form [--sysroot (first [/foo /bar])]
    == &quot;--sysroot first /foo /bar&quot;

    red&gt;&gt; form [--sysroot (first [/foo /bar])]
     == &quot;--sysroot first /foo /bar&quot;

I don&#39;t see that helping a whole lot.  Evaluating the group would make more sense.

    &gt;&gt; form [--sysroot (first [/foo /bar])]
    == &quot;--sysroot /foo&quot;

As an aside, I&#39;ve always thought FORM is a weird name for this.  Maybe it needs a better name. 

But whatever it is, I think we need something like it for putting together bash-like &quot;sentences&quot;, without having to use so many quotes...because every character adds up:

    &gt;&gt; spaced [{--sysroot} (first [&quot;/foo&quot; &quot;/bar&quot;])]
    == &quot;--sysroot /foo&quot;

I&#39;ll point out that having greater flexibility on what is a legal PATH!, permitting **foo/bar/** and **/foo/** etc. really is already helping a lot for common cases of writing shell-like scripts.</description>
