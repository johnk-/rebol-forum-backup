    <title>Operator meaning &quot;complete fully&quot;...what is that?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/operator-meaning-complete-fully-what-is-that/792</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like something to help notice when an operation did not consume all its input.

Something along the lines of:

    &gt;&gt; (completely-consume add 1 2)
    == 3

    &gt;&gt; (completely-consume add 1 2 3)
    ** Error: ADD did not completely consume args, leftover is [3]

I&#39;ve wanted such a thing for a while, but it&#39;s especially pressing now.  The API is getting more solid, so it&#39;s tempting to use it for doing things like calling from C the &quot;System helpers written in Rebol&quot;... a.k.a. what&#39;s in SYS.  But the existing mechanisms for doing that have a &quot;no leftovers&quot; flag, something like:

    DECLARE_LOCAL (result);
    bool leftovers = false;
    if (Apply_Throws(result, add_function, leftovers, arg1, arg2, arg3, rebEND))
        fail (Error_No_Catch_For_Throw(result));

I don&#39;t want such flags in the API.  It seems useful to have a generic operator.

In the past, I&#39;ve tried &quot;double-bar&quot;, because it would allow for a more forceful kind of separation than just a single bar.  Unfortunately, it has to be prefix...as there&#39;s no way at present in usermode to know the left hand side completed exactly one expression:

    &gt;&gt; (x: add 1 2 &quot;foo&quot; | print x)
    3

    &gt;&gt; (|| x: add 1 2 &quot;foo&quot; || print x)
    ** Error: extra stuff ([&quot;foo&quot;])

I&#39;m wondering if the idea of `||` is sound, but just needs a new piece of machinery.  Because this seems superior for the intent:

    &gt;&gt; (x: add 1 2 &quot;foo&quot; || print x)
    ** Error: extra stuff [&quot;foo&quot;]

    &gt;&gt; (x: add 1 2 || &quot;foo&quot; print x)
    ** Error: extra stuff [print x]

    &gt;&gt; (x: add 1 2 || print x &quot;foo&quot;)
    ** Error: extra stuff [&quot;foo&quot;]

    &gt;&gt; (x: add 1 2 || print x)
    3

So what do people think?  Better ideas for the prefix operator?  Time for a new parameter marker, e.g. `&lt;solo&gt;`?

This *might* be something that could be a use for the debated &quot;variadic left enfix&quot;.  Maybe it could be possible to take a value from the left, and then tell you if you were at the &quot;tail&quot; or not...while not actually being able to give you more than one value?  They&#39;re lost to history, but it wouldn&#39;t be hard to keep just a bit&#39;s worth of memory for this purpose.

As an API client it would be up to you to put it at the beginning or the end (or both?)

    REBVAL *v = rebRun(&quot;||&quot;, whatever, ..., ...);

    REBVAL *v = rebRun(&quot;whatever&quot;, ..., ..., &quot;||&quot;);</description>
