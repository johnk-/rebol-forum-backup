    <title>Improving prot-http</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/improving-prot-http/60</link>
    <description>The main issues I see with prot-http are

- the lack of a trace as in SMTP and pop3
- the lack of flexibility with regard to errors
- the contortions one has to go through in adding custom headers for aws Amazon
- the lack of control when there&#39;s a http redirect
- others I can not quite think of at 5 am !

Anyway, it&#39;s time to see if we can correct some of these issues as they are all in user space.

It&#39;s been suggested we switch to using a http2 library but on the other hand we do get to stress the language to see how far we can go when we do this in user code.</description>

            <p>I don't know.  Is there a compliance test we can do?</p>
<p>But for the simple</p>
<pre><code>read http://www.rebolchat.me 
</code></pre>
<p>that is a shortcut for open, read and close so there's no point is there in being 1.1?</p>
<p>And when I was looking through the source the very first time, I thought - hmm, Gabriele implemented chunking so why isn't this <code>HTTP 1.1</code> ?</p>

            <p>Did we determine that it was limited to HTTP/1.0, or is it "temporarily" hardcoded to that due to some problem with 1.1?</p>
