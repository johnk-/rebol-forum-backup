            <p>The C portion of the console is written directly to use <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/33587abc6ca41ccae4b2a4068e3b8a807e7f944c/extensions/stdio/readline-posix.c#L541">POSIX terminal control codes</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/33587abc6ca41ccae4b2a4068e3b8a807e7f944c/extensions/stdio/readline-windows.c#L731">Windows terminal API</a>.</p>
<p>That C code is very granular.  Each keystroke is handled, and the cursor is "painting" by jumping around positions and redrawing the line as you input.</p>
<p>This could be used as a basis of implementing something curses-like, if there were a "console port" feeding these events to the user.  Right now, that isn't happening.  The events are being fed to more C code... but that C code makes heavy use of libRebol and communicates in terms of Rebol values:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/33587abc6ca41ccae4b2a4068e3b8a807e7f944c/extensions/stdio/p-stdio.c#L69">%p-stdio.c</a></p>
<p>But right now, the priority is to make more of this code common so you can write commands that work on Windows, Linux, Mac, and in the Web Console.</p>
<p>Advanced features for "drawing" on the screen in consoles is thus not really a super high priority unless those features fit in with what the web version is going to do.</p>
