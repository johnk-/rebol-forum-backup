    <title>New Testing Feature: @COLLECT-TESTS</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/new-testing-feature-collect-tests/1681</link>
    <description>Historically there were a lot of lines in test files that were the moral equivalent of:

    ; Test the `=` operator
    (1 = 1)
    (2 = 2)
    (3 = 3)
    ...97 lines later...
    (100 = 100)

I&#39;m really not exaggerating much.  Someone really did like filling up pages with tests like this.

(There&#39;s an argument which can be made that if you&#39;re testing some basic facilities you might want to start with something more like that, because you haven&#39;t established trust in the higher-level language facilities well enough to know that they&#39;re working to generate the tests.  :-/)

I myself don&#39;t like seeing pages of tests like that, so I&#39;d just make a single test that would iterate and fail if anything went wrong:

    (count-up index 100 [
        do compose [(index) = (index)]
    ]
    true)

But that&#39;s kind of lame.  The test log just gives you output of &quot;succeeded&quot; or &quot;error&quot;.  You don&#39;t get a view of which iteration was bad on an error, and you don&#39;t get a view of the tests that ran successfully.

## Meet @COLLECT-TESTS

In your test file, you can now say:

    @collect-tests [
        count-up index 100 [
            keep-test compose [(index) = (index)]
        ]
    ]
 
Then the log would show all the tests that were generated, and if 5 of them succeed but 95 don&#39;t you&#39;ll see the source and the error for all of them.

This notation isn&#39;t necessarily final, but I just picked it to jump off the page a little bit.</description>
