    <title>Dialecting URL!s...Should They Ever Be Strings?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/dialecting-url-s-should-they-ever-be-strings/1763</link>
    <description>So I just tried to use a URL! in PARSE and found it was an error.  It&#39;s an error in R3-Alpha, too:

    r3-alpha&gt;&gt; parse http://example.com/foo [http://example.com &quot;/foo&quot;]
    ** Script error: PARSE - invalid rule or usage of rule: http://example.com

Red treats it as a string:

    red&gt;&gt; parse http://example.com/foo [http://example.com &quot;/foo&quot;]
    == true

**But if you think about it, this is a pretty limited application of the datatype.**

* If your input is a string, you&#39;re saving two characters over putting it in braces or quotes, like **`[&quot;http://example.com&quot; &quot;/foo&quot;]`**

    * Ren-C has generic quoting, so there&#39;s quoted URL!s with a single character as another option... **`[&#39;http://example.com &quot;/foo&quot;]`**

* If what you&#39;re matching against is a URL it&#39;s only going to match the very beginning part.

## Could It Fetch Rules From A Network?

In some cases--like the COMPILE dialect--you can build a list of code and libraries to put together, along with user natives.  It&#39;s neat there to have URLs be interpreted as fetching from the network.

But that seems a bit strange for UPARSE.  You&#39;d depend on caching *(you wouldn&#39;t want to do a network fetch each time you hit the URL! in the rule...?)*  In Ren-C you can kind of do this minus the caching, e.g.

    uparse data [... :(load http://example.com/rules/) ...]

## Could It Be Commentary?

In the test dialect, I thought it might be nice to just be able to drop URLs in the middle of things without having to make them comments.  It doesn&#39;t save that much, but can look more clean:

    [
        #386
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Some_Related_Topic
        (1 + 1 = 2)
    ]

I&#39;ve also sometimes wondered about this for function specifications.

    foo: func [
        http://example.com/this-explains-this-function
        return: [integer!]
        arg [integer!]
    ][
        ...
    ]

This doesn&#39;t seem a good fit for PARSE behavior, but I kind of want to mention the idea of different ways that URL! might be used.

## In UPARSE It&#39;s Customizable...Leave it Open?

One possibility would be to say that URL! doesn&#39;t do anything by default, and you can make a URL! combinator that decides what it does do.

How useful would it be?  I don&#39;t know.

**I&#39;m just questioning whether the knee-jerk response of treating URL! as a string (or matching a URL! value if block parsing) is obviously the way to go.**</description>

        <title>Dialecting URL!s...Should They Ever Be Strings?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[hostilefork]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Just because I came across it, here's another example from Rebmake:</p>
<pre><code>gen-entries: meth [
    return: [object!]
    parent [object!]
    /PIC "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code"
][
   ...
]
</code></pre>
<p>Is it a waste to use URL! as just another string type, for the sake of saving some quotes and maybe getting a different syntax coloring?</p>
<pre><code>gen-entries: meth [
    return: [object!]
    parent [object!]
    /PIC https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Position-independent_code
][
   ...
]
</code></pre>
<p>Something nags me saying that URL! should have a deeper meaning than saving on the quotes.</p>
<p>But what?  What would a URL in that spot mean if not a "see also" link?</p>
