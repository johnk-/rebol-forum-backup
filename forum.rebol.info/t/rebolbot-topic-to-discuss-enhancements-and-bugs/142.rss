    <title>Rebolbot - topic to discuss enhancements and bugs</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/rebolbot-topic-to-discuss-enhancements-and-bugs/142</link>
    <description>One of the annoyances that has plagued [SO chat](http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/291/rebol) has been the appearance in the feeds of incorrectly categorized feed items, eg #REbol and _red_ tags from newbie questions on SO.

I just noticed an undocumented API feature which has been exploited [here](https://stackapps.com/questions/7442/ro-chat-message-delete-option) which seems to say that if a room owner posts 

    /messages/$messageid delete

within 2 minutes, even feed items can be deleted.

I think the simplest way is to do something like this

    @rebolbot delete feed

and it deletes the last feed item within 2 minutes of the current time.</description>

            <p>I've just updated the authentication mechanism which can be used by rebolbot.</p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/gchiu/rebolbot/blob/master/so-speak.reb" rel="nofollow noopener">so-speak</a> script takes advantage of a new write header dialect word of 'no-redirect so we always get the same object structure  returned</p>
