    <title>Collective Code Construction Contract</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/collective-code-construction-contract/670</link>
    <description>This is what is used by [ZeroMQ](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/).

I think we should be looking at something like this.  We need to start delegating and separating tasks out.  At the current rate @hostilefork is going to burn himself out.

One of the things they talk about is the separation of maintainers ( who commit code ) from contributors who create patches.   The maintainer doesn&#39;t have to know much programming, but just has to know about Git and how to commit patches, and hopefully to make sure the process is followed.  For instance, a patch should not break user code.  If it does, this leads to a new release number.

So, if we agree a process needs to be followed so that we don&#39;t self-destruct, do we have volunteers?</description>
