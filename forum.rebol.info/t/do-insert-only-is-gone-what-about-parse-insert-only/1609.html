          <p>For reasons that I imagine were performance-oriented, the original design of PARSE did not use PATH!s.  So instead of INSERT/ONLY the sequence of INSERT ONLY was two keywords.  This resulted in a kind of variadic behavior <em>(which is more awkward for the UPARSE combinators, because of the consistency of their patterns in argument gathering)</em>.</p>
<p>With UPARSE, I didn't see any real reason why a combinator couldn't have refinements.  So I went ahead and threw an /ONLY on.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; uparse [[a b] [c d]] [
      collect [some [
          keep/only ([keeping a block])
          keep/only block!
      ]]
   ]
== [[keeping a block] [a b] [keeping a block] [c d]]
</code></pre>
<p>But <a href="../the-long-awaited-death-of-only/1607.html">/ONLY is on its way out</a>.  The concept is you quote things, using a new "arsenal of quoting mechanics".</p>
<p>So what can you do?</p>
<p>I'd already had it so that <strong>^[rule]</strong> would act just like <strong>[rule]</strong> but literalize the result.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; uparse [a] [^[word!]]
== 'a
</code></pre>
<p>But I was using ^word, ^pa/th, ^tu.p.le, and ^(gr o up) to mean "match the literal thing".</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; pattern: [some integer!]

 &gt;&gt; did uparse [[some integer!] [some integer!]] [some '[some integer!]]
 == #[true]

 &gt;&gt; did uparse [[some integer!] [some integer!]] [some ^pattern]
 == #[true]
</code></pre>
<p>If you squint, it sort of lines up.  There's quoting involved; but it adds a level to the rule, not the synthesized result.</p>
<p>But it would be a waste to have the careted <strong>^[a block]</strong> mean literally match [a block], since that's already what the quoted <strong>'[a block]</strong> means.  So I'd gone with this other meaning.</p>
<p>Going back to our example, it forces us to use blocks around the rules in order to get the caret benefit:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; uparse [[a b] [c d]] [
      collect [some [
          keep ^[([keeping a block])]
          keep ^[block!]
      ]]
   ]
== [[keeping a block] [a b] [keeping a block] [c d]]
</code></pre>
<p>That's obnoxious.  <strong>So I changed it to where ^ always means to quote the synthesized rule product.</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; uparse [[a b] [c d]] [
      collect [some [
          keep ^([keeping a block])
          keep ^block!
      ]]
   ]
== [[keeping a block] [a b] [keeping a block] [c d]]
</code></pre>
<p>Due to the ability to <a href="../if-action-combinators-dont-impress-i-dont-know-what-will/1608.html">use plain ACTION!s as combinators by ending in /</a>, you have that option...as well as to put your quotes inside a GROUP! if you're running code:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; uparse [[a b] [c d]] [
      collect [some [
          keep (quote [keeping a block])
          keep quote/ block!
      ]]
   ]
== [[keeping a block] [a b] [keeping a block] [c d]]
</code></pre>
<p>And we can always make QUOTE a combinator so the / isn't needed, if we think that's worthwhile.</p>
<p>(While we're on the subject, doesn't it really seem like <strong>keep quote block!</strong> makes more sense than <strong>keep only block!</strong>?  It's like it means what it says, and the mechanics all tie it together.)</p>
<h2>We'll Need Something Else for Lookup and Match Exactly</h2>
<p>I still think the @ variants seem palatable for the purpose:</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; pattern: [some integer!]

 &gt;&gt; did uparse [[some integer!] [some integer!]] [some @pattern]
 == #[true]
</code></pre>
<p>It could be a named combinator like EXACT, but the issue there is it would need to either quote its argument or it becomes inconvenient:</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; did uparse [[some integer!] [some integer!]] [some exact (pattern)]
 == #[true]
</code></pre>
<p>This is one of the nice things about using the datatype as a combinator, in that it can break outside the rhythm of what plain expressions do and seem to justify it.  It's not that we <em>can't</em> take the arguments literally and fetch a variable without a GROUP!, but explaining that <strong>some exact pattern</strong> and <strong>some exact [pattern]</strong> aren't identical becomes a tax.  :-/</p>
<p>What makes me nervous about this is if @[...] is used for datatypes, and I wouldn't like the overlap there.  It may be that datatypes really just use something else, not yet designed.  I dunno.</p>
<h2>Seems Like Clearly the Right Adjustment</h2>
<p>Having all of the ^ family of operators act consistently and give the quoting really makes it nice for living in a post-ONLY world.</p>
<p>The way I've done it is neat because it's dynamic and inherits whatever the base is.  So if you change the combinator for BLOCK! or WORD!, the ^[...] and ^xxx combinators will change to quote whatever they do.  But you can also override these combinators if you want as well.</p>
