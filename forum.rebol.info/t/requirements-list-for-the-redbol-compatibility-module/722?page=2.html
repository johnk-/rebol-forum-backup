<p>A choice to write scripts to that version of Ren-C will not receive support or bugfixes from me.  Which would make it a difficult choice.  It also lacks TLS 1.2.</p>
<p><strong>This is partially my fault, by being unable to satisfy a finished-enough subset of the language to call "Beta/One" where experimental features are labeled thusly and be satisfied.</strong></p>
<p>One has to realize though just how many concerns are in play.  And it doesn't just involve the <em>in-language</em> stuff you see, or even the <em>in-core</em> stuff almost no one will ever see...but also the inter-language APIs which an in-between number of people to see.</p>
<p>I know it may be hard for the usermode folks to understand just how <em>patently bad</em> <a href="https://doc.red-lang.org/en/libred.html" rel="nofollow noopener">libRed</a> is by comparison to the mechanics of libRebol.  I don't know if I can get you to take my word for how important getting all this stuff right is, but it is important...</p>
<p><strong>This is partially everyone else's fault, by seeming more excited (rightly or wrongly) in seeing what we can do with the web.</strong></p>
<p>But I was won over as a convert.  This is what reshaped my thought that a Ren-C-powered Redbol--which has desktop and browser availability--is the only answer for those who don't want to participate in the experimental portion of the "grand experiment".  At least for the near term.</p>
<p>To make Redbol code work as expected, <code>lib/append</code> (or whatever) will have to act like Redbol append.  So the underlying Ren-C lib of primitives will have to be <code>lib3</code> or something.  Conveniences in a module header for saying which Ren-C-isms you would like might be added as well.</p>
<p>This means you'll have access to those Ren-C-isms you find worth it.  We can even bring in "approved" sets of experiments for the ones people consider truly indispensible, and honor backwards compatibility for those:</p>
<pre><code>Rebol [
    Title: "How we might name experimental sets"
    Experiments: [17-Jan-2020 specialize adapt]
]
</code></pre>
<p>So if SPECIALIZE and ADAPT haven't been committed to in terms of their interfaces, then you could name a date and then the interested parties could build adapters for after when those words have been retaken for new interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>So Redbol is the only option for "documented and stable", and it <em>does</em> exist in a form today.</strong></p>
<p>It's not terribly pretty, and it contains a bunch of archaic code from what used to be called <code>&lt;r3-legacy&gt;</code>.  A lot of that could be written much better with modern Ren-C.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/master/scripts/redbol.reb" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/master/scripts/redbol.reb</a></p>
<p>I mentioned I'd gotten a simple PDF out of Gabriele's PDF maker.  Redbol is used to build <a href="http://hostilefork.com" rel="nofollow noopener">hostilefork.com</a> via a static site generator.  With more people willing to hack on Redbol and take it on--with a GitHub issue database of its own and getting it to run through Red's test suite--it could advance.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've gone from seeing building old Rebol2 compatibility as being a chore to thinking of it as a demonstration of the true power of Ren-C and what makes it possible for a Rebol-like language to bend to what you want it to be.  What worries me are the technical challenges of binding and such that have yet to be solved--modules never <em>really</em> worked.</p>
<p><strong>The other option is commit to the experiment, roll with the punches, write tests and tell me where your source is and I help you keep it up to date.</strong>  I can only do this for a limited number of projects which pretty much have to be of interest to a wide audience--certainly wider than just the author themselves.</p>
