            <p>I know you are aware of what you are doing.<br>
Very happy with all those efforts!<br>
But I remember some occasions where I had my program crash where the debug behaved very well. That really is something that can drive you mad.<br>
Maybe one build is enough to maintain though. Else those will diverge as well. :-/</p>

            <ul>
<li>
<p><strong>It would not be feasible to force all user scenarios to use all debug instrumentation.</strong> Some instrumentation causes big performance hits, but that is critical to keeping the system working.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>I'm not going to delete all debug instrumentation just for the sake of not having different builds.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>There's no track record of bad bugs that have resulted in this project from over-reliance on debug instrumentation.</strong>  Quite the contrary, there's a track record of really slick mechanics actually working.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While some people may not know what they're doing, I do <em>(most of the time)</em>.  So there will continue to be instrumentation that is used for my purposes to keep the code doing cool things.</p>
<p>I will say that if I sense there is a potential that a release build variant behavior isn't getting tested in the debug build, I make it semi-random to run both ways.  That's what the SPORADICALLY() macro is for:</p>
<pre><code>#if defined(NDEBUG) || !defined(DEBUG_COUNT_TICKS)
    #define SPORADICALLY(modulus) \
        false
#else
    #define SPORADICALLY(modulus) \
        (TG_Tick % modulus == 0)
#endif
</code></pre>
<p>Because it's driven by the interpreter tick count, it will reproduce taking the alternate behavior sometimes.</p>
