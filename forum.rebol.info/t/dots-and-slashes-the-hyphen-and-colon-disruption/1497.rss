    <title>Dots and Slashes: The Hyphen and Colon Disruption</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/dots-and-slashes-the-hyphen-and-colon-disruption/1497</link>
    <description>I&#39;d gotten the idea in my head from looking at code that dots were superior to slashes for field selection.

I do think it looks less noisy in basic cases:

    if system.options.quiet [print &quot;Be quiet!&quot;]

    if system/options/quiet [print &quot;Be quiet!&quot;]

But when you combine it with colons, it&#39;s a little less obvious:

    system.options.quiet: true

    system/options/quiet: true

The dot doesn&#39;t contrast as well with the colon as the slash does.  It&#39;s a little close to **`system.options.quiet.`**

Another issue is how the dot doesn&#39;t stand out quite as much from dash as a slash does:

    system.console.print-info &quot;Scans kind of like (system.console.print)-info&quot;

    system/console/print-info &quot;More obvious scan as system/console/(print-info) ?&quot;

But it probably as a lot to do with &quot;what you&#39;re used to&quot;.   We certainly are able to group together hyphenated clauses in filenames all the time, like **some-file.txt** so I am probably just being a bit jarred by seeing a new pattern.  Looking at it side-by-side here, I guess you could probably just as easily see the `-info` as being broken off from the slashes if you wanted to see it that way...

Overall, I feel like the benefit of distinguishing function refinements from field selection is high enough to warrant shifting to dots.  But I just was a bit surprised that I didn&#39;t instantaneously think it was 100% better-looking.  :-/</description>

<p>Bolstering my instincts here is that in Carl's latest <a href="https://altscript.com/?p=116">"AltScript" side project</a>, he has caved to the use of dots for field selection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"<strong>Dots are used for field selection</strong>. For example, “person.name” refers to the name field of the person object. Slashes are not used for selection. Use of a dot for selection is common in many other languages."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've gone ahead and <strong><a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/commit/5a8b332f100aa105f54e2df9290b6db2ed59ef24">made UPARSE a first guinea pig of the slash-to-dot conversion</a></strong>, which meant fixing some binding features so it could work.</p>
<p>I think it's an improvement, helping make it clearer when things are function calls vs. field selections.</p>

<p>Forgive my heresy, but if you have any desire to make JavaScript devs feel at home with Ren-C, I think adopting the dot path notation is relatively harmless syntax sugar. I've thought about trying to make dot-paths in dialects to make the syntax closer to other languages I'm trying to mimic, but it's a hassle.</p>
