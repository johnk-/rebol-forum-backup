    <title>Tuple Troubles: Version 0.3.01 vs 0.3.1</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/tuple-troubles-version-0-3-01-vs-0-3-1/1755</link>
    <description>For better or worse, versioning in Rebol has used TUPLE!.  e.g. 0.3.1 is 32-bit Windows, and 0.3.40 is 64-bit Windows

If you go back and look at the old R3-Alpha file **[%systems.r](https://github.com/rebol/rebol/blob/25033f897b2bd466068d7663563cd3ff64740b94/src/tools/systems.r#L21)** you can see that it&#39;s pretty typical for Carl to have written the versions out with leading zeros...*but only in the third slot*.  So `0.3.01` but not `00.03.01`

But ultimately the tuple discards this information.  And this has been the way it always worked:

    rebol2&gt;&gt; 0.3.01
    == 0.3.1

    red&gt;&gt; 0.3.01
    == 0.3.1

    ren-c&gt;&gt; 0.3.01
    == 0.3.1

This leads to problems when you are working with string representations outside of Rebol (say in bash shell, something like &quot;0.3.01&quot;) and you pass it into Rebol to process as a tuple.  If bash went and created a directory based on the string...you won&#39;t match if you FORM that tuple later.

You could insist on passing around the tuple as a string, but that undermines the value of having the version be in a tuple in the first place.

I&#39;d say that the simplest solution is just to stop writing tuples with the leading zeros...instead keeping them in their canon form.  0.3.1 for 32-bit Windows, and 0.3.40 for 64-bit Windows.  Then make the directories reflect this, e.g.:

    https://dd498l1ilnrxu.cloudfront.net/travis-builds/0.3.1/r3-573037b-debug.exe

and not:

    https://dd498l1ilnrxu.cloudfront.net/travis-builds/0.3.01/r3-573037b-debug.exe

That leading zero comes with a whole lot of headaches, so I say hunt them down and get rid of them.  Because non-Rebol systems are going to only operate on them as strings and they&#39;ll leak.</description>

            <p>I think I had some occasions, where 1.2.3 got actually interpreted as 1.2.30 .<br>
I'm definitely in favour of cleaning this up.</p>

            <p>since the members of a tuple! are integers, then we don't use leading 0s for integers so that makes sense.</p>
<p>Presumabley we keep 0.3.40 because the last element is 40 and not 4</p>
