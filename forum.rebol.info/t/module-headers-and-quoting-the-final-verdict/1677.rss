    <title>Module Headers and Quoting: The Final Verdict</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/module-headers-and-quoting-the-final-verdict/1677</link>
    <description>So there&#39;s been a long historical fight on whether you need quotes on module header fields...:

    Rebol [
        Title: {Your title here}
        Type: &#39;Module
        Name: &#39;Your-Module-Name-Here
    ]

...or if you don&#39;t, and you can just say:

    Rebol [
        Title: {Your title here}
        Type: Module
        Name: Your-Module-Name-Here
    ]

This wasn&#39;t a tremendously huge problem in historical Rebol, because the standard fields did not take WORD! types.  The issue was on the rise with the `Type:` and `Name:` fields in modules.

**While I have flipped back and forth on which I support, I have never flipped on the idea that this has to be a standardardized.**

But today, I think my verdict on which way to go is pretty clear.

## Just Say No! &lt;sub&gt;(To Ticks In Unevaluated Contexts)&lt;/sub&gt;

It&#39;s visual pollution that serves no purpose.

Really, this is a dialect in a BLOCK!.  It uses SET-WORD!s.  It is not an OBJECT!.

You can make an object out of it, but you need to be careful about it.  Not only do you not have to evaluate module headers, *you should not evaluate module headers*.

It seems to me that the TO OBJECT! conversions can handle this; it fits the bill of my rule of TO not doing evaluation.  So the old &quot;CONSTRUCT&quot; operation can go.

## Exception: When Quotes are Part of the Dialect

If you come up with your own header field, used for your own script type&#39;s purposes, use quotes if you want...if the quoting has meaning.

Maybe you have some kind of generic thing like `initial-value:` up top in the header.  And that can be ANY-VALUE!, so anything you want to run a test on--for instance.  If you have:

    Initial-Value: &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;&lt;foo&gt;

Then that&#39;s fine.  But for fields like the module&#39;s type, there is no such distinction in meaning intended by &#39;Module vs. Module.  So that&#39;s different.</description>

</aside>
<p>This is worth talking about, especially in light of the question of if binding is going to wind up being case-sensitive.</p>
<p>I have a hard time telling if I actually prefer the capitalization or am just used to it.  :-/</p>
<p>For the moment there are bigger things to focus on, but this will have to be reasoned about someday.</p>

<p>Well no capitalization is fine. Next thing would be CamelCase.<br>
<strong>type: module</strong><br>
looks even better.</p>

            <p>I will also add that I think <strong>Type: module</strong> looks better than <strong>Type: Module</strong>.</p>
<p>Discussion of the capitalization of the keys is something that needs study as well.  But it seems to be following email header conventions... e.g. <strong>From: bob@wherever</strong></p>
<p>The script library doesn't really enforce any consistency on these points, but right side words are pretty much always lowercase.</p>
