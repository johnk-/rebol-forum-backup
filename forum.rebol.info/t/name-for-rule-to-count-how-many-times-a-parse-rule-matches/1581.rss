    <title>Name for rule to count how many times a PARSE rule matches?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/name-for-rule-to-count-how-many-times-a-parse-rule-matches/1581</link>
    <description>There are cases where you want to know how many of a certain match there are.

Here&#39;s an example:

     uparse &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;stuff&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; [
         (n: 0)
         some [&quot;&lt;&quot; (n: n + 1)]
         x: between here n &quot;&gt;&quot;
     ]

Here I&#39;m just trying to match the number of `&gt;` on the right to how many `&lt;` were on the left.

*(Note: I still think this INTEGER! abstracting of rules is confusing to read.  Is a REPEAT/LOOP keyword missing that would help?  [I&#39;ve written about this, please register an opinion.](https://forum.rebol.info/t/is-integer-in-parse-too-obfuscating/1578))*

## This Feels Like It Needs A (Value-Bearing) Rule

Maybe call it TALLY ?

     uparse &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;stuff&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot; [
         n: tally &quot;&lt;&quot;
         x: between here n &quot;&gt;&quot;
     ]

I&#39;m reluctant to call it COUNT since that&#39;s used so often as a variable name / noun.  But TALLY seems like fair game.

[**For now, it&#39;s checked in as TALLY for UPARSE**](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/commit/937eb630ee0e976ba6db3a8003d804fbfa2eedd5)

But the main thing to focus on here is just how much killer leverage we get when parse rules can fit into this extensible framework.  [And my major point I raised about synthesizing values that are not restricted to the type of the input.](https://forum.rebol.info/t/lessons-from-encapping-improving-binary-parse/1577)</description>
