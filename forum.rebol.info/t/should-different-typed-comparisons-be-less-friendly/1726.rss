    <title>Should Different-Typed Comparisons Be Less Friendly?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/should-different-typed-comparisons-be-less-friendly/1726</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve historically been on the side of saying that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good for types of different categories to compare equally, e.g. **`&lt;foo&gt; = &quot;foo&quot;`** being true can cause some headaches.

But these headaches can work the other way as well.  I just had a bug where I was passing something as a string, but the caller was comparing it as a WORD!.

     if info.name = &#39;startup* [
         ...  ; it was a string, so actually &quot;startup*&quot;
     ]

This makes me wonder if different-typed comparisons need some distinction in the comparison, to help say that you know the type you&#39;re comparing against is completely different.

    if info.name =T &#39;startup* [
       ;
       ; ugly example... but imagine =T is a way of saying &quot;I know the type
       ; should be the type on the right (e.g. WORD!), so tell me if it is
       ; not...
    ]

    &gt;&gt; &#39;foo =T &#39;bar
    == #[false]

    &gt;&gt; &quot;foo&quot; =T &#39;bar
    ** Error: =T expected a WORD! on the left but got a TEXT!

It&#39;s always the latest such bug to bite you in languages of this nature that make you wish for stricter typing policies.  :frowning:</description>
