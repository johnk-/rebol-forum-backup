    <title>Console Transcript Replay: I Want It</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/console-transcript-replay-i-want-it/1711</link>
    <description>*I&#39;m moving this from a post I made that was tied up with suggestions about changing the prompt away from **`&gt;&gt;`** to make it more obviously taken as an asymmetric delimiter.  This is an interesting feature which can be discussed in its own right...* 

---

Let&#39;s imagine someone tells you they&#39;ve set **x: 1**, and then have the following code:

    &gt;&gt; x + 2
    == 3

    &gt;&gt; print &quot;hi&quot;
    hi

Try pasting that today, say, in Red and you will get:

    &gt;&gt;      &gt;&gt; x + 2
    *** Script Error: &gt;&gt; operator is missing an argument
    *** Where: catch
    *** Stack:  

    &gt;&gt;      == 3
    *** Script Error: == operator is missing an argument
    *** Where: catch
    *** Stack:  

    &gt;&gt; 
    &gt;&gt;     &gt;&gt; print &quot;hi&quot;
    *** Script Error: &gt;&gt; operator is missing an argument
    *** Where: catch
    *** Stack:  

    &gt;&gt;     hi
    *** Script Error: hi has no value
    *** Where: catch
    *** Stack:  

## But What If...

...imagine you could go on a website, drag across someone&#39;s transcript, and paste it right into your console unedited and have it run.

What I&#39;m talking about is knowing that you are receiving a paste (either by virtue of an API that tells you, or just noticing that the rate at which lines are coming in is faster than a human types...a heuristic I have been meaning to implement so that lines are batched instead of intermixing with the output).  And really being able to just paste a console transcript whole cloth, but have it respond by outputting its own complementary transcript.

So now let&#39;s say your transcript looked like:

    &gt;&gt; x + 2
    == 3

    &gt;&gt; print &quot;hi&quot;
    hi

So if you pasted it into an environment where you&#39;d said **x: 10** it would take the data one line at a time, and &gt;&gt; would kick it over into a replay mode

    &gt;&gt; x: 10
    == 10

    &gt;&gt; ; here you do the paste, it sees the &gt;&gt; and kicks over

    [[ TRANSCRIPT PASTE DETECTED ]]
    ( to disable, see http://rebol.info/disable-transcript-paste-detection )

    ; &gt;&gt; x + 2
    ; == 3
    ;
    ; &gt;&gt; print &quot;hi&quot;
    ; == hi

    [[ REPLAYING TRANSCRIPT ]]

    &gt;&gt; x + 2
    == 12

    &gt;&gt; print &quot;hi&quot;
    hi

## ...Heuristics, hmmm... :face_with_monocle: 

If we keep the current indicators for prompts, e.g. **`&gt;&gt;`** and **`==`** with **`**`** for errors, then we&#39;d be making heuristic decisions here...since these are all things you can legally use elsewhere.  

**==** is in common use today as an operator, though it rarely appears at the beginning of a line.  I intend it to *not* be an operator, but a divider of some kind.  So it actually be contentious, because although == doesn&#39;t appear at the start of a line today, it would as a divider.  So maybe plain equals, just off by one space?

    &gt;&gt; x + 2
     = 12

Parity just looks confusing, don&#39;t think anyone would get used to it:

    &gt;&gt; x + 2
    &lt;&lt; 12
Anyway, now that I&#39;ve outlined this feature, I want it yesterday.  The value of such a feature may exceed the value of dedicating `&lt;&lt;x&gt;&gt;` as some new lexical type for MAP! or similar.</description>

            <p>It  could also be interesting to have this work like a test, with an indication which value was in the transcript, and which value was computed in the session.</p>
