    <title>Changelog-at in userlib</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/changelog-at-in-userlib/80</link>
    <description>This is a new user function

    do &lt;changelog&gt;

and used as

    changelog-at rebol/commit

which takes your browser to the commit associated with the binary you are using.  Unlike the GitHub commit which does not change, it is hoped that the rebolchat notes will be updated by their authors.

It only looks at the last 10 commit notices by default and can be changed using the /limit refinement.</description>
