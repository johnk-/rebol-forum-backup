    <title>Enfixing ALSO, stylizing it after THEN and ELSE</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/enfixing-also-stylizing-it-after-then-and-else/402</link>
    <description>As we contemplate re-stylizing operations to embrace enfix more, one kind of historically ugly construct that could use an improvement is ALSO.

Consider this line from IN-DIR:

    also do block change-dir old-dir

This is a shorthand for writing:

    (temp: do block, change-dir old-dir, temp)

But this can be done just fine with ELIDE (!)

    (do block, elide change-dir old-dir)

So wouldn&#39;t it be more interesting if ALSO could be in the same family as THEN and ELSE, perhaps being like a THEN that doesn&#39;t modify the result?

    tester: func [num] [
        switch num [
            1 [&lt;one&gt;]
            2 [&lt;two&gt;]
         ] also [
            print &quot;It was one or two&quot;
         ] else [
            print &quot;It was neither one nor two&quot;
         ]
    ]

    &gt;&gt; tester 1
    It was one or two
    == &lt;one&gt;  ; the ALSO branch ran, but didn&#39;t modify the overall result

    &gt;&gt; tester 3
    It was neither one nor two

I like that it&#39;s the same number of letters as THEN and ELSE.  :-)</description>

            <p>The historical ALSO always plays havoc with my comprehsion, an enfix form looks far more natural to me.</p>
