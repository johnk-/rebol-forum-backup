<h1>REBOL header</h1>
<p>We need these fields in the REBOL header</p>
<pre><code>REBOL [ File: %... Date: dd-mmm-yyyy Title: "..." Purpose: {......} ]
</code></pre>
<p>You can have other fields in the REBOL header, but we need the ones above.</p>
<h2>REBOL header: File</h2>
<p>The name of the script -- eg <strong>%my-script.r</strong> or <strong>%yet-another-map.r</strong></p>
<p>File should follow these conventions</p>
<ol>
<li>Start with a percentage sign, %, like any other REBOL file!</li>
<li>Contain only <strong>lower-case</strong> letters, digits, or hyphens. This ensures cross-platform compatibility</li>
<li>Don't start or end with a hyphen (<strong>%-my-script</strong> and <strong>%myscript.r-</strong> are not good)</li>
<li>Should have a suffix (eg <strong>.r</strong>). It doesn't <strong>need</strong> to be <strong>.r</strong>, but that is strongly recommended</li>
<li>Not be a <strong>reserved file name</strong> for any of the platforms that REBOL runs on (e.g. con or lpt1 are reserved under Windows)</li>
<li>For a new script, has a name that does not clash with any other script in the Library</li>
</ol>
<h2>REBOL header: Date</h2>
<p>Should be a valid REBOL date. We use this to index recent changes and additions, so you should really set it to today's date,</p>
<p>eg <strong>Date: 20-Aug-2021</strong>.</p>
<h2>REBOL header: Title</h2>
<p>A short string that descibes the script</p>
<h2>REBOL header: Purpose</h2>
<p>A string, possibly multi-line, that briefly describes the script. This is displayed on the <strong>View</strong> screen and other places. <strong>Purpose</strong> is optional, but highly recommended.</p>
<h1>Library header</h1>
<p>This is part of the REBOL header, and includes extra fields for cataloging your script. A basic library header looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>library: [
    level: 'intermediate
    platform: 'all
    type: [tutorial tool]
    domain: [ftp game]
    tested-under: none
    support: none
    license: none
    see-also: none
]
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>Library header</strong> is optional. You do not need it, but it does let you easily associate <strong>tags</strong> with your script.</p>
<h2>Library header: Level</h2>
<p>A single quoted word to say what level of user expertise is embodied in the script. That is, the level of REBOL understanding that a user should have. It doesn't have anything to do with the domain-specific aspects of an entry. Use any one of: <strong>advanced beginner intermediate</strong></p>
<p><strong>beginner</strong> - These should be understandable even to those that are just evaluating REBOL. We don't want to scare off newcomers.</p>
<p><strong>intermediate</strong> - This assumes a basic working knowledge of REBOL and the ability to use HELP and SOURCE to learn more. Script size isn't as important as complexity. That is to say, scripts can be large as long as they are straight-forward.</p>
<p><strong>advanced</strong> - Examples of things that fall into this category would be: higher order functions, USE blocks - beyond very obvious usage, BIND, anonymous functions - again beyond very basic usage of the mechanism, dynamic layout generation in View, etc.</p>
<h2>Library header: Platform</h2>
<p>The platform(s) on which this script will run. Can be a lit-word or block. Use any combination of:</p>
<pre><code>*nix all amiga be linux
mac plugin solaris unix win
windows
</code></pre>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre><code>Platform: [all plugin be]

Platform: 'be
</code></pre>
<p>Most scripts will have no platform specified, which means they are expected (though not guaranteed) to work on any platform their target REBOL product runs on.</p>
<h2>Library header: Plugin</h2>
<p>If a script has a <strong>platform: [ ... plugin ...]</strong> entry (meaning it is certified as runnable under the REBOL browser plugin) it must also have a Library header of <strong>plugin</strong> to specify the settings needed by the plugin</p>
<p>Values are:</p>
<pre><code>plugin: [size: pair! version: string!]
</code></pre>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>size -- the width and height of the window needed for the script to display properly. <strong>This value must be present</strong>. Minimum size is 100x100.</li>
<li>version -- specific version number of the plugin, if the script needs anything other than the most recent version
<ul>
<li>This is optional -- omit if you do not mind which version is run</li>
<li>The <strong>only</strong> version currently allowed is "<a href="http://www.rebol.com/plugin/rebolb4.cab#Version=0,5,0,0">http://www.rebol.com/plugin/rebolb4.cab#Version=0,5,0,0</a>"</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>rebol [ ... library: [ ... plugin: [size: 800x1000] ... ] ]
</code></pre>
<h2>Library header: Type</h2>
<p>Says what type of thing the script is, or how it is used. What its purpose is. Can be a lit-word or block. Use any combination of:</p>
<pre><code>article demo dialect faq fun
function game how-to idiom module
one-liner package protocol rebcode reference
tool tutorial
</code></pre>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre><code>Type: [demo dialect]

Type: 'tutorial

Type: [article dialect protocol]
</code></pre>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<p>These are things you can just click and see something happen. They may be useful or not.</p>
<p><strong>Demo</strong> - These are written to show REBOL off in some way. Good examples are Cyphre's graphic demos, Doc's v-balls, gel, and splash. Yes, you may learn something from their code, but their goal is to just look cool and show off. All demos will have a display of some kind, even if it's just a console. Scripts like rebodex.r and to-do.r might fall into two categories with a small change. They are good demos as they come with sample data, but they could also be Utilities if you were allowed to change the data they contain and persist those changes. Calculator is both a demo and a utility.</p>
<p><strong>Tool</strong> - Tools and Utilities provide some kind of useful functionality. Some of them may also be good demos, easy-vid being a classic example. Effect-lab is another good example, because it shows you the effect block it's building up and you can copy it out for your own use.</p>
<p><strong>Game</strong> - Games are games. If you can play it, it's a game.</p>
<h3>Documentation Related</h3>
<p>Things in this category may be documents of some kind other than a REBOL script, though scripts may also be included. Their intent is to inform, teach, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Reference</strong> - Non-script entries would be things like dictionary.html or the view developer's guide from RT. It would also apply to easy-vid, view-ref, and other "active" documents.</p>
<p><strong>How-To</strong> - The new REBOL Cookbook is kind of in line with this. They can be code without a separate article, or explanatory text may be included.</p>
<p><strong>FAQ</strong> - Answers to simple questions. May be code or not. More concise than How-To's, but along the same lines. They should fit well as answers to a "How do I...?" question.</p>
<p><strong>Article</strong> - These are items that are mainly text, but may also contain code. They are targeted at informing people about REBOL, not being technical.</p>
<p><strong>Tutorial</strong> - I'd classify the REBOL Forces Articles as tutorials. They are explanatory, but contain code. Longer and deeper than a How-To.</p>
<p><strong>Idiom</strong> - These are the little nuggets that show you the inner 'zen' of REBOL. There may be overlap between FAQs, one-liners, and Idioms. e.g. How do I concatenate strings? or How do I upload a file with FTP? Idiom entries should be small and well focused.</p>
<h3>Code</h3>
<p>This is the area for things that don't do anything on their own.</p>
<p><strong>One-liner</strong> - If it fits on one line, it qualifies.</p>
<p><strong>Function</strong> - A function (like Round.r) or a set of functions (like prime.r) that can be called or included in other scripts. They usually return a result.</p>
<p><strong>Module</strong> - A function (or set of functions) that does something (like lrwp.r or melt.r). Generally these would define a context/namespace to avoid collisions.</p>
<p><strong>Protocol</strong> - A full-blown protocol (like mysql_all.r). You should be able to determine if something qualifies for this by looking for "make root-protocol" and/or "net-utils/net-install" in the source.</p>
<p><strong>Dialect</strong> - Some dialect scripts might also fall into other categories. It doesn't necessarily mean that all they do is provide a dialect (i.e. set of parse rules). Andrew's ML stuff is a good example, as is make-doc. It just means that a dialect of some kind is a prominent component of the functionality, though it may also be <strong>just</strong> a set of parse rules (and docs to go with them of course).</p>
<h3>Mode of running</h3>
<p><strong>Rebcode</strong> - Ther script runs in the Rebcode Virtual Machine.</p>
<h2>Library header: Domain</h2>
<p>What application area(s) the script addresses. All scripts should have at least one domain that they applies to them, and they may have more than one.</p>
<p>Not all application areas are "published". The user view, so far, is much more limited. i.e. just because we have a domain listed doesn't mean it will appear as its own group in the user interface of library tools or the web/html version.</p>
<p>Can be a lit-word or block. Use any combination of:</p>
<pre><code>ai animation broken cgi compression
database db dead debug dialects
email encryption extension external-library file-handling
files financial ftp game graphics
gui html http ldc markup
math mysql odbc other-net parse
patch printing protocol scheme scientific
sdk security shell sound sql
ssl tcp testing text text-processing
ui user-interface vid visualization web
win-api x-file xml
</code></pre>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<pre><code>Domain: [db external-library protocol]

Domain: 'cgi

Domain: [game mysql text broken sdk]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Patch</strong> - A patch is an updated version of a mezzanine that ships with a standard REBOL distribution. Some of them will come from RT and others will come from users. There are a couple different reasons people write patches. For RT, it's a way to fix bugs without having to do an entire release of REBOL. Patches from RT are considered "official", but that doesn't mean they're perfect of course. Some patches change behavior because someone thinks the original behavior is incorrect, or inadequate. These have to be treated carefully as having patched functions that behave differently can be quite confusing. If you write a patch, make sure to comment it clearly as to what the purpose of the patch is.</p>
<h2>Library header: Tested-under</h2>
<p>Notes about the testing environment used. This field is designed to give people at least a hint about where the entry is known to work, or maybe that it wasn't tested at all. A <strong>string</strong>, <strong>block</strong>, or <strong>none</strong>.</p>
<h3>NOTE:</h3>
<p>We've talked briefly about the following dialect, but have not yet committed to it or updated existing scripts to use it. Comments are welcome.</p>
<pre><code>values: Given in groups, as follows:

    product version OS [opt notes] [opt tested-by]

    product: word! ; command view core base IOS SDK
    version: tuple!
    OS: opt 'on [word! | string! | block!]
    notes: opt string!
    tested-by: opt 'by [word! | string! | block!]

example values:

    tested-under: [core 2.5.3.3.1 W2K]
    tested-under: [view 1.2.8.3.1 on "Windows 98"]
    tested-under: [
        command 1.2.5 on [Win2K Me 98] "Sunanda"
        command 2.1.1 on [W2K] "Anton"
        command 2.0.0 on [linux] [Gregg Volker]
    ]
    tested-under: [
        base 2.6.0 W2K {Patched in http protocol from Core 2.5.3} by GSI
    ]
</code></pre>
<h2>Library header: Support</h2>
<p>The standard header already contains a Home field, which should be used if it exists. The standard Author and EMail fields should also be used. The library Support field is there for the cases where the original author of an entry no longer supports it, or never did, but someone else steps up to fill that void. You may also include notes about any support you offer (e.g. "See my website for plug-ins"). A <strong>string</strong>, <strong>block</strong>, or <strong>none</strong>.</p>
<p>A block is the preferred format, since that makes it easy to include, and find, email addresses and URLs among the comments.</p>
<h2>Library header: License</h2>
<p>Conditions under which the script can be used. See <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/index.html">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/index.html</a> for information about various open source licenses. A <strong>string</strong>, <strong>lit-word</strong>, <strong>block</strong>, or <strong>none</strong>.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.rebol.org/license-help.r"> help on choosing a license </a>for more details.</p>
<p>The standard Copyright field should also be used if appropriate.</p>
<p>Standard licenses are:</p>
<pre><code>bsd cc-by cc-by-sa gpl lgpl
</code></pre>
<p>mit pd public-domain rvd</p>
<h2>Library header: Replaced-by</h2>
<p>This is an optional header -- most scripts will not have it. Use it only if you want to show that this script has been replaced by another.</p>
<p>Rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Format is a <strong>file name</strong> . eg <strong>replaced-by: %new-script.r</strong>
</li>
<li>The replacing file must already exist in the Library (so add it first)</li>
<li>The replacing file must not itself have a <strong>replaced-by</strong> entry</li>
<li>You can't replace a script with itself (<strong>replaced-by</strong> script name must be different to the current script's)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Library header: See-also</h2>
<p>Cross-reference to other scripts of interest. A <strong>string</strong> or <strong>none</strong></p>
<h3>Note:</h3>
<p>We've talked about using this simple dialect:</p>
<pre><code>some [[file! | url!] opt string!]
</code></pre>
<p>where file! values would be links to other library scripts, url! values would be links to external references, with optional notes included for each. Since things are still in flux, we haven't talked about how relative paths might be included and such.</p>
