    <description>Rebol and Red have quite a few cool features - this is PR for them. 

In this category topics will focus on some of the more interesting feature in an introductory manner, somewhat like a blog post. In fact, if you&#39;ve already written about some part of Rebol or Red elsewhere, feel free to write a summary paragraph pointing to your post or a complete transcription (copy and paste) here.</description>
