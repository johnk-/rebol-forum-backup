<p><em>To that extent, I'm going to somewhat "sanitize" the history to make it easier to absorb.  e.g. NULL was <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/null-in-the-librebol-api-and-void-null/597">initially called void</a>...but for simplicity let's pretend it was just always called null.  And there was no modern sense of TRY, it was called TO-VALUE.  I'll try not to interrupt the flow by calling out such points inline.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Rebol historically had two "unit types": NONE! and UNSET!.  Instances of both were values that could be put into blocks.</p>
<p>Ren-C started out with two parallel types: a simple renaming of NONE! called BLANK! (to match its updated appearance as <code>_</code>), and NULL (a purified form of UNSET! which could not be put in a block).</p>
<p>The original NULL was "ornery" like an UNSET!.  It was neither true nor false (caused an error in conditionals)...and it was the same state used to poison words in the user context against misspellings and cause errors.  With NULL being so mean, BLANK! was the preferred state for "soft failures"...it was still the outcome of a failed ANY or ALL, or a failed FIND.</p>
<p>But as the point was rigorous technical consistency, something like a failed SELECT would distinguish returning BLANK! from NULL.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; select [a 10 b 20 c _] 'c
== _

&gt;&gt; select [a 10 b 20] 'c
; null
</code></pre>
<p>This provided an important leg to stand on for the operations that needed it (crucial to those trying to write trustworthy mezzanines).  While casual users might not have cared or been able to work around it, writing usermode code that could be reliable was quite difficult without routines that were able to make this distinction.  Too many things had to be expressed as natives, otherwise the usermode forms to be "correct" would be circuitous and overworked.</p>
<p>Along with this, failed conditionals were made to return NULL too.  This provided a well-reasoned form of the pleasing behavior that made it into my <a href="../the-canonical-list-of-non-negotiables/1244.html">non-negotiables list</a>:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; compose [&lt;a&gt; (if false [&lt;b&gt;]) &lt;c&gt;]
== [&lt;a&gt; &lt;c&gt;]
</code></pre>
<p>There was no ambiguity as there was in Rebol2 (or as continues to be today in Red).  They don't do my "non-negotiable" behavior, and has no way to put an UNSET! value into a block with COMPOSE...even though it's a legitimate desire, and you will get one with REDUCE:</p>
<pre><code>red&gt;&gt; data: compose/only [(none) (do []) 1020]
== [none 1020]

red&gt;&gt; data: reduce [(none) (do []) 1020]
== [none unset 1020]

red&gt;&gt; compose [&lt;a&gt; (if false [&lt;b&gt;]) &lt;c&gt;]
== [&lt;a&gt; none &lt;c&gt;]  ; as with Rebol2, R3-Alpha, etc.
</code></pre>
<h2>NULL's Prickliness Runs Up Against a Growing Popularity</h2>
<p>As mentioned: by not being able to be put in blocks, NULL became the clear "right" mechanical answer to things like a failed SELECT.  But it caused some friction:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; if x: select [a 10 b 20] 'c [print "found C"]
** Error: cannot assign x with null (use SET/ANY)
</code></pre>
<p>Even if you had been able to assign null variables with plain SET-WORD! in those days, it would not be conditionally true nor false.  You'd have to write something like  <strong>if value? x: select ...</strong> or <strong>if x: try select ...</strong> or <strong>if try x: select ...</strong></p>
<p>The rise of the coolness of ELSE also made it tempting to use NULL in more and more places.  Those sites where BLANK! had seemed "good enough" since they didn't technically need to distinguish "absence of value" were not working with ELSE: ANY, ALL, FIND.  Attempts to reason about why or how ELSE could respond to BLANK! in these cases fell apart--and not for lack of trying.  This gave way to the idea of a universal protocol of "soft failure" being the returning of NULL.</p>
<p><strong>NULL was seeming less like the pure form of UNSET!, but more like the pure form of NONE!</strong>.  Its role in the API as actually translating to C's NULL (pointer value 0) became a critical design point.</p>
<p>The writing seemed to be on the wall that this non-valued state had to become conditionally false.  Otherwise it would break every piece of historical code like:</p>
<pre><code>if any [...] [...]
if find [...] ... [...]
if all [...]
</code></pre>
<p>This would start developing tics like:</p>
<pre><code>if try any [...] [...]
if value? find [...] ... [...]
if ? all [...]  ; one proposed synonym for VALUE?, still a "tic"
</code></pre>
<h2>NULL Becomes Falsey, VOID! Becomes the New Meanie</h2>
<p>It felt like Ren-C was offering rigor for who wanted it.  You now knew when something <em>really</em> didn't select an item out of a block.  All functions had a way of returning something that <em>really</em> couldn't mean any value you'd want to append anywhere.</p>
<p>But with a popular NULL that required GET-WORD! access to read it, the illusion of greater safety was starting to slip.  <strong>:my-mispeled-variable</strong> was NULL too.</p>
<p>A path of reasoning led to the argument of resurrecting an ANY-VALUE! type which was not NULL that would be prickly.  That's been called VOID!.  It's more or less like an UNSET!, but terminologically makes more sense.  <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/pull/1029" rel="nofollow noopener">I put it thusly</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I like VOID because it's the return value of functions that aren't supposed to have any usable result. But more accurately, think of a paper check that has VOID written on it. You can still hand it to people, and you can get in trouble if you try to cash it. But you can't cause a problem by trying to cash a NULL check because there's no paper and nothing written on it--it is the literal absence of a check."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>VOID! became a preferred choice for when branches accidentally became null (voidification).  It replaced the previous "blankification" which was harder to catch anything unexpected happened, because blanks were so innocuous:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; if false [null]
; null

&gt;&gt; if true [null]
== #[void]
</code></pre>
<h2>Where This Stands Today</h2>
<p>If the <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/pull/1029" rel="nofollow noopener">latest proposed change is adopted</a>, reading NULLs out of a plain WORD! does not cause an error.  VOID! more or less makes what was considered error-worthy in Rebol2 the same.  And we come to a point where the "soft failures" of NULL are nearly as quiet as the "soft failure" of NONE! was historically.</p>
<p><strong>"All we get" for Ren-C's trouble is more rigor for those who want it.</strong></p>
<p>But that's a pretty pessimistic way of looking at it, because the rigor was the original motivation: to be able to write short clear usermode routines where you could be confident they were as correct as you could make a native.  And there's actually a lot of ways in which the nulls raise errors when passed as parameters to things that don't take NULL (but which have behaviors for BLANK!).  Yet under the proposal <em>all refinements are implicitly optional arguments, hence NULL says nevermind</em>.  I feel good if that's what you meant, but uneasy if it wasn't.</p>
<p>But since if NULLs have been "defanged" so much that you can assign and use them, we need some short way of throwing in errors.  I've talked about an inverse parallel to ENSURE called NON which could do things like NON INTEGER! or NON NULL:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; append x non null select [a 10 b 20] 'c
** Error: NON did not expect a NULL but received one
** Near: non null ** select [a 10 ... (blah blah
</code></pre>
<p><a href="../we-really-need-a-better-name-for-really/1250.html">I've started a separate thread to talk about a shorter name for "non null"</a>.  But this kind of my best idea so far of how to address a world where soft failures are accepted by every refinement (and some arguments).  If your failure is a logic failure--e.g. something semantically really wrong happened which was not obvious from the routine itself (like FIND not being able to find something is a known result), then don't use NULL.  It's too nice now.  Use VOID! or raise an error.</p>
<h2>"Conclusion"</h2>
<p>I'll probably run with the null change a while before pushing it on others, to see what other thoughts it provokes.  But really--any comments help!</p>

<p>what if <strong>foo: null</strong> was shorthand for voiding a word?</p>

</aside>
<p>Creative ideas always welcome.  But bending mechanics in such a way has pretty serious costs.  I tried what I thought was a <a href="../should-append-null-fail-append-blank-add-nothing-unless-only/635/5.html">cool zany idea</a> involving blanks turning into nulls...and quickly realized that any benefits it had were eclipsed by pulling the rug out from under people.</p>
<p>While it may seem that writing a REPL is "easy", it's actually pretty complex because it deals in the full bandwidth of the language.  And you realize that if you can't say:</p>
<pre><code> value: do usercode
 print-value :value
</code></pre>
<p>Then it's a pretty big challenge to your system.  I feel it's a slippery slope if you can't get an accurate reading out of that, and it would sacrifice a lot of the "must...be...accurate" that NULL brings to the table.</p>

          <p>I'm still not settled in my understanding of this concept. The reasoning appears to hold until I try it in practice.</p>
<p>If I can try and distill it in another way, it's as if BLANK! has split into two with a measure of VOIDing a positive branch that returns NULL for whatever reason, e.g. <strong>if true [null]</strong>, the purpose of the latter is to enable ELSE/THEN.</p>
<p>I recall one other reason for a NULL/BLANK split not mentioned was using BLANK! as MAP! values without the associated key disappearing.</p>
<p>I'd be curious if we could further enumerate the ways in which the NULL/BLANK distinction offers more rigour as on the other hand, the finessing of these values does introduce additional complexity.</p>
<p><em>I should say that as of now, I don't have a favourable opinion of the ELSE/THEN idiom (on a stylistic/comprehension basis) and don't think they're worth the extra complexity alone, I'm looking to understand other circumstances where the distinction is critical.

<p>It'd be conceivable in a VOID/BLANK-only world to imagine <strong>select [] 'c</strong> returning VOID as an indicator of no-match, similarly <strong>my-map/non-existent-key</strong>. In a world where <strong>val: void</strong> does not bomb, then <strong>val: my-map/non-existent-key</strong> wouldn't in itself be a showstopper.</p>

          <p><strong>I accept being skeptical of voidification, which seems to me the crux of your complaint.  I'm willing to look at concrete challenges and imaginative mechanics which may make this less painful.</strong></p>
<p>However...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'd be curious if we could further enumerate the ways in which the NULL/BLANK distinction offers more rigour as on the other hand, the finessing of these values does introduce additional complexity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>NULL is simply non-negotiable.  In contrast to my eagerness to delving into possible better ideas for voidification... I'm not particularly enthusiastic at this moment to sink more time writing up an extended defense of NULL, and feel that at some point you have to take my word for something that I've written about for years.</p>
<p>But... <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/man_shrugging.png%3Fv=9" title=":man_shrugging:" class="emoji" alt=":man_shrugging:">  It started back with feeling I <em>must</em> be able to say <strong><code>compose [&lt;a&gt; (if false [&lt;b&gt;]) &lt;c&gt;]</code></strong> and have it unambiguously give back <strong><code>compose [&lt;a&gt; &lt;b&gt;]</code></strong> without concern that there is some meaningful variant I'm missing which I might have wanted to do.  The failed control structure must return a <em>non-thing</em>, otherwise this is in question.  We've discussed SELECT needing an unambiguous signal for "not there" vs "was there and was nothing".  Maps not having a value, etc. etc.</p>
<p><strong>NULL is a requirement at an API level, and a semantic level, and countless features will not work practically without it.  Its existence is simply not possible to revisit.</strong>  If you like features in Ren-C that are cool, then whether you know it or not, you <em>really</em> like NULL, a lot.</p>
<p>OTOH... we <em>could</em> question whether BLANK! itself is truly necessary.  Does there really need to be a falsey placeholder type?  Could people use the tag <code>&lt;nothing&gt;</code> or an empty string, etc.?  But if such a beast does exist--and I think you'd want it to--there's interesting options for how it can be used as a sort of "reified twin" to NULL.  Right now the only real way in which the system treats it special (beyond its falsey status) is the convention of letting it signal opting out of arguments, and getting a <a href="https://github.com/rebol/rebol-issues/issues/1611#issuecomment-385719133" rel="nofollow noopener">nice form of error locality in chains</a>.</p>
<p>But back to the <em>real</em> issue...</p>
<p><strong>Your valid complaint here is voidification, and whether it's worth the cost of distorting the output of control constructs for a feature you dislike.</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, understand this feature goes beyond enabling ELSE and THEN.  It's an answer to the question of <em>"can someone from the outside of a control construct unambiguously know if it took a branch or not?"</em> and <em>"can someone from the outside of a control construct unambiguously know if it did a BREAK or not?"</em></p>
<p>Being able to glean this knowledge from the outside is important even for those who do not care to use ELSE and THEN.  Imagine you are writing a wrapper for a loop construct out of two other loops, and you want that construct to be able to implement BREAK.  <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/the-simple-yet-powerful-magic-of-the-loop-result-protocol/609/4">With the NULL being a signal that unambiguously means BREAK, you can do so.</a></p>
<p><strong>We could make NULL branches preserve falseyness but not nullness via "blankification" instead of "voidification".</strong>  But I think voidification gave you more of an alert that you hit a distorted case and have to use another method.</p>

</aside>
<p>As we're talking about falsey situations, note that falsey cases have always faced "distortion":</p>
<pre><code>rebol2&gt;&gt; all [true true false]
== none
</code></pre>
<p>You lost the false, <em>though not the falsey-ness</em>.  So blankification has that going for it.</p>
<p><strong>I'd really like to look at concrete examples--as you know that I do not like it when there's not a "good" answer to a complaint.</strong>  I'm really thinking about this idea of being able to get undistorted branches out:</p>
<pre><code> &gt;&gt; case [true [null]]
 ; void

 &gt;&gt; case [true :[null]]
 ; null
</code></pre>
<p>It seems like a little bit to waste for GET-BLOCK!, which I had hoped to have mean REDUCE.  But that is only a shorthand, and not actually that helpful...since it would only work if the block you wanted to reduce was literal.  This may be its higher calling.</p>
<p>Although the existence of such an escape would prevent wrapping (e.g. the wrapping of control constructs or loops to mirror out whether branches were taken or whether it hit a BREAK).  Maybe this is acceptable in the sense of "not everything is going to work easily"...wrappers that want to support GET-BLOCK! branches will need to be more clever.  <em>Or maybe you simply understand that if you use a GET-BLOCK!, and a null is given, you are effectively un-signaling that the branch was taken...even though it was.  But that's the meaning you understand you intend.</em></p>
<p>But overall: <strong>My own instincts are that it's probably on balance done mostly right, and that by merely converting code you're only seeing the needed workarounds as burdensome without appreciating the benefits.</strong></p>

<p>When you go down the road of BLANK!/("NONE!") trying to serve two masters...as both thing-and-not-thing...people will complain if there's no way to literally compose blanks into stuff.</p>
<p>When we talk about complexity that needs to be managed, <em>you're going to have to manage it somewhere</em>.  The NULL/BLANK! distinction provides leverage in the implementation and puts the responsibility on you to know which you mean, at the right time.

<p>It's not necessarily intrinsic that BLANK! needs to be <em>falsey</em>, if your complaint is about not preserving the value precisely...</p>

<p>That's just something you're used to.  But it makes it seem that inhibiting BLANK!s use in compatibility layers seem not worth it...you could have just used <code>&lt;null&gt;</code> if you wanted something truthy and placeholdery.</p>
<p><strong>We have to be looking at more than just one annoyance.</strong>  The number of creative solutions afforded is high, and one has to appreciate the benefits in a holistic sense to be willing to think it's worth it to rethink how old code is written.  But the new way for that old code might be even better.  Can't know unless I'm reading it too.</p>

<p>Because they lack invisibles, they face an uphill battle with trying to make return results that opt out.  So an already poor idea like making UNSET! truthy leads to questions of why things wouldn't return UNSET! so they could just opt out of an ANY, while they would end an ALL.  Generic ELIDE becomes a perfect tool for this once you get comfortable with it.</p>
<p>Because they lack a NULL state, they only have the option of a reified UNSET!...which due to its reified nature, may be seen when enumerating blocks.  Writing mechanically correct code is nigh impossible.</p>

<p><strong>We have to be looking at more than just one annoyance.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I get that, that's why I'm asking. I have THEN/ELSE, the vanishing NULL—which I get and appreciate that to go about it from the legacy BLANK-only approach might get messy—and some other items (SELECT BLANK vs. nothing), and the fidelity of CASE/SWITCH/IF/etc.. However I see the BLANK/NULL split as messy too and I'm trying to justify all the ways it is necessary, because I'm having a difficult time balancing the pros/cons of each and wondering if one set of inconveniences do indeed outweigh the other. I'm as sincere as I can consciously be in approaching this with an open mind and apologies if this has indeed been enumerated elsewhere.</p>
<p>I've read this thread over and I feel I get the basic concepts. It just starts to hit me when I start to actually use them.</p>

<p>I accept being skeptical of voidification, which seems to me the crux of your complaint. I'm willing to look at concrete challenges and imaginative mechanics which may make this less painful.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>And your particular situation raises an important point about the complexity cost... that it's affecting even people who aren't using the feature.</p>
<p>Why would someone writing the following be affected by the needs of ELSE?</p>
<pre><code> pos: case [
     x &gt; 0 [find [a b c] 'd]
     true [find [d e f] 'g]
 ]
</code></pre>
<p><em>"They need to be trained in case one day they use ELSE and get confused"</em> didn't convince you.  And having seen the epicycles of the problem, I've moved from empathy to agreement.  In particular because it seems once you start using ELSE the mechanics of working around this guarantee you'd be confused regardless.</p>
<p>The separation of concerns is wrong; and this is bothersome enough that another mechanic is needed.</p>
<h2>NULL Isotopes: Measurably Better</h2>
<p>Having done some fairly convincing tests, and putting the big picture together...I'm ready to embrace a concept that I had initially thought of as "too weird", which I'm putting under the label <strong>"NULL isotopes"</strong>.  That is to say that there are nulls which embed a signal informing the reactions of things like ELSE and THEN.</p>
<p>The analogy with atomic isotopes is pretty good, in that there is a "common form" to which the NULLs will decay (e.g. each WORD! or GET-WORD! fetch will lose the isotope status).  Hence handling the isotopes is a somewhat delicate matter for those constructs involved with it.  But the isotope form to the average observer is indistinguishable from the common form...you usually don't have to care, unless you have a reason to care.</p>
<p><strong>It checks the box that this complexity need not concern people who aren't using the features.</strong>  Beyond just pleasing a reluctant audience for said features, it also is hints that the design is separating concerns correctly.  Voidification has a fully parallel set of concerns when you look at the whole picture, but lacks this critical advantage.</p>
<h2>Sounds Scarier Than It Is</h2>
<p>Having been able to rig it up in a matter of minutes, including the feel-good purge the <strong><code>if foo @[null]</code></strong> branch cases... I was actually surprised by how clean it is.</p>
<p>One thing making it easier to swallow is NULL's already ephemeral nature.  Since it can't be stored in blocks, you're not getting "values" with a sneaky bit on them that could bear data.</p>
<p><em>I really like that architectural aspect; that we're not talking about a generic bit that suddenly has to apply to all values.</em>  Contrast with if the proposal was that there was an isotope form of 7 that would trigger an ELSE, and a plain 7 that wouldn't.  That would be a disaster (and reminiscent of the infamously bad LIT-WORD! decay.)</p>
<p>Having this be a targeted property--applied only to the non-valued NULL, to tie-break a very specific point--has the feeling to me of what <em>design</em> really is.  Not only do I like it not being a generic bit, we don't have many generic bits to spare.  So this can get tucked away as a detail of NULL (which uses nearly none of its cell payload, it has plenty of free bits).</p>
<p><strong>Even with only a little bit of experience with it...I think it's safe to say this idea is stronger than voidification.</strong>  So the better solution is at least this, if not something better.  I'd say voidification is all but dead.</p>

<p>What I have called NULL-2 should--if it works correctly--not concern you, as someone who doesn't care about ELSE or THEN.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; compose [a (case [true [null]])]
== [a]
</code></pre>
<p>That CASE returned a "null-2", and not a "null-1".  You don't need to care.  It answered yes to <strong><code>NULL?</code></strong>.</p>
<p>If you look at the rest of the implications of the design, it has pushed any concern about NULL variations upon those who want to manage NULL-reactivity to THEN and ELSE.  It does so by damping down the existence of NULL-2 as much as it can.</p>

          <p>It's not that it bothers me, I'm just still trying to better understand the intersection of VOID/NULL/BLANK/LOGIC as it pertains to values and flow—I don't yet have a settled story myself about why this is a necessary improvement over BLANK! as flow currency.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that's not my responsibility, but if there isn't a THEN or ELSE, is NULL still essential? Can't issues of discerning BLANK! as a value—say as a MAP! value with better use of VOID! ?</p>
<p>I'm also still curious how this drives THEN/ELSE as it pertained to my own misunderstanding on how I tried to use ELSE once—would need to look up the example, but I think it was something like:</p>
<pre><code>is-more-than-five: func [value][
    case [
        value &lt; 6 [null]
        value &gt; 5 [value]
    ]
]

is-more-than-five 1 else [print "Else"]
</code></pre>
<p>I'm not trolling here, I'm trying to understand under the terms of the topic title what are the essential problems breaking NULL out of BLANK/VOID solve. I'm not intentionally being dense either—I believe to really understand this, I need to hash out all the flow cases and enumerate the advantages, a daunting prospect</p>

<p>I've outlined why that works now, because <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/pull/1099">functions can't return a "NULL-2" unless they use a special RETURN form</a>.</p>
<p>This addresses the subtlety and "radioactivity" and why I've pulled everything together here for fitness for purpose, after heavy consideration.</p>

<p>Then be sure to paste your examples into the interpreter that follows the rules at hand <em>(and, yes, I have to figure out why the heck the web interpreter is giving 2-day old timestamps and answers, but clearly that's a pipe of wasm/AWS/Travis that's a bit deep to even be engaging in the first place...)</em></p>

          <p>I'm not saying you're wrong, I just don't understand why you're right</p>
<p>The elevator pitch for the addition of NULL is that you can add the new language constructs THEN/ELSE and that NULL vapourizes when reduced.</p>
<p>I don't have any code to show you because I'm reluctant to invest the effort to produce that code unless I can appreciate the reasons why it's worth doing so (besides attempting to kick the tires)—it's a non-trivial change to the way the language has worked.
