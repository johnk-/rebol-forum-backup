    <title>Removing &quot;&amp;&quot; from Legal Word Characters - Any Objections?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/removing-from-legal-word-characters-any-objections/1180</link>
    <description>The **&amp;** character is not usually a legal character in identifiers in programming languages, and is saved for operators and such.

I have not seen much in the way of good uses of **&amp;** in names... it&#39;s rather ugly.

    AT&amp;T: &quot;this seems pretty pointless&quot;

Even if we took it away from word characters we could have exceptions such as for **&amp;** and **&amp;&amp;** where those standalone could be WORD!, if anyone really cared about that.

One of my pet usage suggestions for **&amp;** has been to embrace the [HTML Entity List](https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref), and allow it as a syntax for characters (minus the semicolon of course).

    append some-string &amp;nbsp  ; adding a non-breaking space by entity name

Also, having that table built into the executable and offering it out could be pretty useful, even preferring to mold a known character using that instead of the numeric form.

This would help reduce the over-saturation of usages of #.  An additional practical matter for that would be that you could specify characters as **&amp;{...}** as well as **&amp;&quot;...&quot;** ... this would help avoid escaping when putting characters in quotes as in the API:

     REBVAL *ch = rebValue(&quot;second [10 &amp;{b} 20]&quot;);

Today we can&#39;t use **#{b}** instead of **#&quot;b&quot;** because that gets interpreted as a binary.  So you have to do this as the less appealing:

     REBVAL *ch = rebValue(&quot;second [10 #\&quot;b\&quot; 20]&quot;);

The same thing happens trying to pass characters in double quotes inside `--do` code on the command line.  I think desire for this duality of forms applies to the other string-like things as well (e.g. FILE! should be able to be either %{...} or %&quot;...&quot;)

**We don&#39;t necessarily need to do it right now, but deprecating &amp; in words ASAP helps clear the path to this or other applications.**

Does anyone have particularly great arguments for why &amp; should be allowed in WORD!?</description>

<p>Maybe.  But I feel like with <code>#x</code> and <code>#"x"</code> and <code>#{x}</code> meaning the same thing, with this also being taken to apply with FILE! with <code>%x</code> and <code>%"x"</code> and <code>%{x}</code>... that it would break the pattern in a non-intuitive way.</p>
<p>We can think about it.  There's also other another option for binaries, as ${decafbad} and $"decafbad"</p>

            <p>I like the token part, and "&amp;" looks Ok for binaries.<br>
Html entities would have been nice, though.<br>
Just an idea, no proposal:<br>
If binaries would need the quoting, then plain &amp;nbsp could be free for char entities...</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>On this topic <em>Removing “&amp;” from Legal Word Characters - Any Objections?</em> I suggested that using <code>&amp;</code> for CHAR! would offer some benefits.  One was similar appearance to HTML entities.  Another was being able to use characters in contexts which were enclosed in double-quotes and would have to escape (like the API):</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-post="1" data-topic="1180">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
<img alt width="20" height="20" src="https://forum.rebol.info/user_avatar/forum.rebol.info/hostilefork/40/26_2.png" class="avatar"> hostilefork:</div>
<blockquote>
<p>An additional practical matter for that would be that you could specify characters as <strong>&amp;{...}</strong> as well as <strong>&amp;"..."</strong> ... this would help avoid escaping when putting characters in quotes as in the API:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> REBVAL *ch = rebValue("second [10 &amp;{b} 20]");
</code></pre>
<p>Today we can't use <strong>#{b}</strong> instead of <strong>#"b"</strong> because that gets interpreted as a binary.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p><strong>What I've been leaning toward lately is going the other way with this...</strong> and giving <strong>&amp;</strong> to BINARY!, while <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/removing-issue-from-the-any-word-category/1106/3">ISSUE! and CHAR! become unified</a> and use the <strong>#</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>issuechar! forms (tentatively TOKEN!)
<ul>
<li><code>#foo</code></li>
<li><code>#"foo bar"</code></li>
<li><code>#{foo bar}</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BINARY! forms:
<ul>
<li><code>&amp;aebd</code></li>
<li><code>&amp;"aebd"</code></li>
<li><code>&amp;{aebd}</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reasons to Favor Binary Moving</h2>
<p>The &amp; character is too loopy and detailed to look very good sitting next to single letters:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; first "abc"
== &amp;a

&gt;&gt; first "abc"
== #a
</code></pre>
<p>When you think about the landscape of things ISSUE! is suggested to be used for, the ampersand is more polluted-looking:</p>
<pre><code>#323-207-META

&amp;323-207-META
</code></pre>
<p>So I feel like # is the better choice here.  Binaries won't suffer so much, because they are typically enclosed in delimiters:</p>
<pre><code>&amp;{decafbad}

#{decafbad}

#{DECAFBAD}

&amp;{DECAFBAD}

&amp;"DECAFBAD"

#"DECAFBAD"
</code></pre>
<p>I actually kind of like the &amp; better, visually.  But beyond that, what I especially like is putting distance from the CHARISSUE! type (TOKEN! still sounding like a good name for the unification).</p>
<p>If we wanted to, we could have binaries be expressed even without delimiters, like <strong>&amp;ffee</strong> or <strong>&amp;0011</strong> ... I don't know how desirable that is.</p>
<aside class="quote no-group" data-post="1" data-topic="1180">
<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
<img alt width="20" height="20" src="https://forum.rebol.info/user_avatar/forum.rebol.info/hostilefork/40/26_2.png" class="avatar"> hostilefork:</div>

<pre><code>append some-string &amp;nbsp  ; adding a non-breaking space by entity name
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So this idea would basically not happen.  This isn't to say we couldn't make it easier to process HTML entities.  But in the theory about tokens, <strong><span class="hashtag">#nbsp</span></strong> would be an immutable literal that fits in a cell and really represents the string content "nbsp".  Though you can imagine dialecting such things...perhaps saying that when you quote them you want them as-is but otherwise an HTML entity:</p>
<pre><code> my-dialect ["abc" #nbsp #nbsp '#nbsp]
 == "abc  nbsp"
</code></pre>
<p>I dunno.  Anyway, wanted to give an update here...as the ISSUECHAR! thing really does look like it's shaping up <em>very well</em> and is seeming extremely likely to happen.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Yes, I think we agree. There is no DWIM here, somewhere, somehow the characters need a map/lookup table. That map could certainly get unweildy to manage manually when you consider all of the foreign character-sets.  So naturally I support this type of proposal.</p>

</aside>
<p>Well we can't achieve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DWIM" rel="nofollow noopener">DWIM</a>.  Are they escaped or not?</p>
<p>The proposal at hand would offer an easy way to speak in terms of the unescaped characters.  It's very early in the thinking process to say <strong>mold first "&gt;"</strong> returning <strong>&amp;gt</strong>, but that is the kind of thing I'm saying is on the table.</p>
<p>(Really the post is about <em>not</em> making this decision, but restricting use of <strong>&amp;</strong> so we can open these doors post Beta/One...)</p>
<p>So in that world, you could search for <strong>unspaced [mold ch ";"]</strong> and replace it, and search for <strong>ch</strong> and replace it.  But again this is highly speculative.</p>

            <p>That looks great. I don't have code examples yet. But to give a more specific example, let's say that I have tens of thousands of text files. Some of these are XML files containing embedded HTML. This requires that the embedded HTML tags are carefully escaped. E.g.,</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;&lt;WYSIWYG&gt;
&lt;GenericHTML&gt;
&lt;Content&gt;&amp;lt;div class="tf module pt-20"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;div class="content"&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;h1 class="tf content-title"&amp;gt;What do I do if I&amp;amp;rsquo;ve found the right event but the date is far off and I&amp;amp;rsquo;m not sure if my plans will change?&amp;lt;/h1&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p class="normal pb-20"&amp;gt;We understand a lot can change in a year or two. If you cancel your plans you&amp;amp;rsquo;ll have your credit restored. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt; &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Note:&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; Fees do not cover insurance.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;

<p>This is really important for a bunch of the things I'm trying to achieve. Working with XML in particular means dealing with a ton of these entities, and I would love to figure out a way to map these so that someone who's searching (in an automated way) for a piece of HTML stored in XML doesn't have to know the myriad character substitutions to do an effective/comprehensive and accurate search.</p>

            <p>The <strong>&amp;</strong> character is not usually a legal character in identifiers in programming languages, and is saved for operators and such.</p>
<p>I have not seen much in the way of good uses of <strong>&amp;</strong> in names... it's rather ugly.</p>
<pre><code>AT&amp;T: "this seems pretty pointless"
</code></pre>
<p>Even if we took it away from word characters we could have exceptions such as for <strong>&amp;</strong> and <strong>&amp;&amp;</strong> where those standalone could be WORD!, if anyone really cared about that.</p>
<p>One of my pet usage suggestions for <strong>&amp;</strong> has been to embrace the <a href="https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref" rel="nofollow noopener">HTML Entity List</a>, and allow it as a syntax for characters (minus the semicolon of course).</p>
<pre><code>append some-string &amp;nbsp  ; adding a non-breaking space by entity name
</code></pre>
<p>Also, having that table built into the executable and offering it out could be pretty useful, even preferring to mold a known character using that instead of the numeric form.</p>
<p>This would help reduce the over-saturation of usages of #.  An additional practical matter for that would be that you could specify characters as <strong>&amp;{...}</strong> as well as <strong>&amp;"..."</strong> ... this would help avoid escaping when putting characters in quotes as in the API:</p>
<pre><code> REBVAL *ch = rebValue("second [10 &amp;{b} 20]");
</code></pre>
<p>Today we can't use <strong>#{b}</strong> instead of <strong>#"b"</strong> because that gets interpreted as a binary.  So you have to do this as the less appealing:</p>
<pre><code> REBVAL *ch = rebValue("second [10 #\"b\" 20]");
</code></pre>
<p>The same thing happens trying to pass characters in double quotes inside <code>--do</code> code on the command line.  I think desire for this duality of forms applies to the other string-like things as well (e.g. FILE! should be able to be either %{...} or %"...")</p>
<p><strong>We don't necessarily need to do it right now, but deprecating &amp; in words ASAP helps clear the path to this or other applications.</strong></p>
<p>Does anyone have particularly great arguments for why &amp; should be allowed in WORD!?</p>
