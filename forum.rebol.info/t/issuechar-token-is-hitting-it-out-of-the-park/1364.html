<hr>
<p>I've kept the ISSUE! name for now, just to not change too many things at once.  And CHAR! is a "type constraint" of a single-character token.  So although the mechanics behind this sort of constraint are destined to change...you can still use CHAR? and match single-character tokens in PARSE via a CHAR! rule:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; parse [#a] [char!]
== [#a]

&gt;&gt; parse [#aa] [char!]
; null
</code></pre>
<p>So don't go changing all your CHAR! to ISSUE!.  If you mean CHAR!, say it.  Just bear in mind that it's a constraint on tokens... not its own unique data type.</p>
<p>The biggest change is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use <strong>CODEPOINT OF</strong> to get the codepoint of a single-character ISSUE!, instead of <code>to integer!</code>.  <em>(Currently you can also PICK the codepoints off of a token positionally, so you could also use FIRST.  But that's not as clear, and I'm also not sure if the behavior is desirable.)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's a hack in so that MAKE CHAR! of an INTEGER! will still work (for now) to get a single-character issue form.  But TO CHAR! of an INTEGER! no longer works.  There's also now <strong>AS ISSUE!</strong> to do this...but I'm not 100% confident that this is what "AS" will mean.  Using MAKE CHAR! is probably the best way to keep the callsites identified for migrating to a final solution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Putting More "Everywhere" Into "UTF-8 Everywhere"</h2>
<p>With the character type actually being an immutable class of string, it's no longer being stored in a cell as an integer codepoint.  <em>It's encoded UTF-8 bytes, living in the memory inside of a cell.</em></p>
<p>When all your strings are encoded as UTF-8, you don't really <em>need</em> the codepoint number all that often.  Usually you're just looking for a character in a string, or appending it to one.  That means having the encoding at hand is more important...and in those rare times you need CODEPOINT OF you pay the cost of decoding the UTF-8 into an integer.</p>
<p>It's the better option.</p>
<h2>Efficient Storage of Short Issues</h2>
<p>There's 7 bytes of space in a cell on 32-bit platforms for UTF-8 encoding (1 byte for terminator), and 15 bytes on 64-bit platforms.  That's enough space for all UTF-8 single character codepoints, and if you're just using ASCII that can be enough for many short strings.</p>
<p>So the benefits aren't just limited to single characters.  The work done to support encoding in cells supports what would have been short issues too.  Notably, RGB patterns like <span class="hashtag">#FFFFFF</span> come in at 6 characters...so they'll fit in a cell even on 32-bit platforms.</p>
<h2>Lighter Notation For Characters</h2>
<p>Not needing the quotes around most characters makes a much nicer impression:</p>
<pre><code>; with quotes

    &gt;&gt; first "abc"
    == #"a"

    &gt;&gt; if #"a" = first "abc" [print "match"]
    match

; without quotes

    &gt;&gt; first "abc"
    == #a

    &gt;&gt; if #a = first "abc" [print "match"]
    match
</code></pre>
<p>We know <strong><code>#a=b</code></strong> is different from <strong><code>#a = b</code></strong> due to whitespace significance, and it's nice to play a card from that hand here.</p>
<p>Of course not all characters fit the pattern, so people will hopefully be sensitive to the idea that <strong><code>#]</code></strong> is an empty token up against a bracket, and <strong>#"]"</strong> is the bracket "token".  Seems learnable.</p>
<h2>Intuitive Similarity between #"1" and <span class="hashtag">#1</span> Becomes Actual Similarity</h2>
<p>Having TO INTEGER #"1" and TO INTEGER <span class="hashtag">#1</span> act differently is just one of many examples of why this shouldn't be a difference.</p>
<h2>Quote Notation Opens Up Forms for "ISSUE!"</h2>
<p>Before, <strong>#"a b c"</strong> was an "invalid character".  Now it's a valid token.  This enables more dialect usages of a unique stringlike type.</p>
<h2>...more...</h2>
<p>It's nice being able to solve situations where you want characters in quotes for things like command lines, and can say <strong><code>"char: #a"</code></strong> instead of <strong><code>"char: #\"a\""</code></strong>.  But taking the <strong>#{}</strong> form from BINARY! would be needed to really generalize that victory.</p>
<p>With tokens being generic enough to hold ANY-STRING! content, I observed that they might be able to be used in an answer for what to do when you wanted a map key to be case-sensitive.  But same-cased ISSUE! and strings haven't compared equal even in Rebol2:</p>
<pre><code>rebol2&gt;&gt; "abc" = #abc
== false
</code></pre>
<p>This means you'd have to turn your string into a token before looking it up in the map.  But since tokens are immutable, that would force your string to become read-only in that process.</p>
<p>It's something predicates might solve, by letting you use a different predicate for lookup than common equality.  Yet the whole premise of map lookups is that they are based on a hash function that reliably produces the same result...so if a map was hashed with one notion of lookup, you can't just pick an arbitrary function...</p>
<p>Anyway, there are things to think through and opportunities that this might create.  I'll be interested to see.  But already, it's a win.</p>

<p>It's nice being able to solve situations where you want characters in quotes for things like command lines, and can say <strong><code>"char: #a"</code></strong> instead of <strong><code>"char: #\"a\""</code></strong> .</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I thought I'd point out a cool example from the console source...where C and Ren-C are getting mixed.</p>
<p>There is a part where WORD!s are being used as virtual keycodes, and then there is C code that wants to react to those codes.  To make it clear/easy/efficient, what happens is that a Rebol SWITCH <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/93cb30376c4c8d79ec01c28c46eb9ac917ac7aed/extensions/stdio/p-stdio.c#L123" rel="nofollow noopener">translates the WORD!s into char` values</a>, that can be used in a C switch statement.</p>
<pre><code>       uint32_t ch = rebUnboxChar(
            "to char! switch", rebQ(e), "[",
                "'escape ['E]",

                "'up ['U]",
                "'down ['D]",
                "'ctrl-b",  // Backward One Character (bash)
                    "'left ['L]",
                "'ctrl-f",  // Forward One Character (bash)
                    "'right ['R]",
                ...

      switch (ch) {
          case 0:  // Ignored (e.g. unknown Ctrl-XXX)
            break;

          case 'E':  // ESCAPE
            Term_Abandon_Pending_Events(t);
            line = rebBlank();
            break;
</code></pre>
<p>You notice that previously, the branches in the switch() didn't use CHAR!.  They used WORD!s, because the escaping of chars would be too annoying.  (e.g. <code>"'escape [#\"E\"]"</code>)  So the WORD!s are translated to chars outside the switch with TO CHAR!.</p>
<p>Now using the ISSUE!s directly in the SWITCH is painless, and there's no need for the conversion:</p>
<pre><code> uint32_t ch = rebUnboxChar(
        "switch", rebQ(e), "[",
            "'escape [#E]",

            "'up [#U]",
            "'down [#D]",
            "'ctrl-b",  // Backward One Character (bash)
                "'left [#L]",
            "'ctrl-f",  // Forward One Character (bash)
                "'right [#R]",
            ...
</code></pre>
<p>It's a cool and sneaky way to push through that cross-language barrier.  Just a reminder that these design points are "deep thoughts"...not change for the sake of change!</p>
