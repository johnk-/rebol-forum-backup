    <title>&quot;ISSUECHAR!&quot; (=&gt; TOKEN!) is Hitting It Out of the Park</title>

    <description>**[The unification of the ISSUE! and CHAR! types](https://forum.rebol.info/t/removing-issue-from-the-any-word-category/1106/3) is having all kinds of better-than-expected consequences.  It is undeniably a good change.** &lt;sub&gt;(though don&#39;t be surprised if Red finds a way to deny it...they still [don&#39;t even bring up the *existence of the concept of UTF-8 Everywhere*](https://github.com/red/red/issues/4131) :see_no_evil: even as it stares them in the face as the answer to things they need!)&lt;/sub&gt;

---
I&#39;ve kept the ISSUE! name for now, just to not change too many things at once.  And CHAR! is a &quot;type constraint&quot; of a single-character token.  So although the mechanics behind this sort of constraint are destined to change...you can still use CHAR? and match single-character tokens in PARSE via a CHAR! rule:

    &gt;&gt; parse [#a] [char!]
    == [#a]

    &gt;&gt; parse [#aa] [char!]
    ; null

So don&#39;t go changing all your CHAR! to ISSUE!.  If you mean CHAR!, say it.  Just bear in mind that it&#39;s a constraint on tokens... not its own unique data type.

The biggest change is this:

* Use **CODEPOINT OF** to get the codepoint of a single-character ISSUE!, instead of `to integer!`.  *(Currently you can also PICK the codepoints off of a token positionally, so you could also use FIRST.  But that&#39;s not as clear, and I&#39;m also not sure if the behavior is desirable.)*

* There&#39;s a hack in so that MAKE CHAR! of an INTEGER! will still work (for now) to get a single-character issue form.  But TO CHAR! of an INTEGER! no longer works.  There&#39;s also now **AS ISSUE!** to do this...but I&#39;m not 100% confident that this is what &quot;AS&quot; will mean.  Using MAKE CHAR! is probably the best way to keep the callsites identified for migrating to a final solution.

## Putting More &quot;Everywhere&quot; Into &quot;UTF-8 Everywhere&quot;

With the character type actually being an immutable class of string, it&#39;s no longer being stored in a cell as an integer codepoint.  *It&#39;s encoded UTF-8 bytes, living in the memory inside of a cell.*

When all your strings are encoded as UTF-8, you don&#39;t really *need* the codepoint number all that often.  Usually you&#39;re just looking for a character in a string, or appending it to one.  That means having the encoding at hand is more important...and in those rare times you need CODEPOINT OF you pay the cost of decoding the UTF-8 into an integer.

It&#39;s the better option.

## Efficient Storage of Short Issues

There&#39;s 7 bytes of space in a cell on 32-bit platforms for UTF-8 encoding (1 byte for terminator), and 15 bytes on 64-bit platforms.  That&#39;s enough space for all UTF-8 single character codepoints, and if you&#39;re just using ASCII that can be enough for many short strings.

So the benefits aren&#39;t just limited to single characters.  The work done to support encoding in cells supports what would have been short issues too.  Notably, RGB patterns like #FFFFFF come in at 6 characters...so they&#39;ll fit in a cell even on 32-bit platforms.

## Lighter Notation For Characters

Not needing the quotes around most characters makes a much nicer impression:

    ; with quotes

        &gt;&gt; first &quot;abc&quot;
        == #&quot;a&quot;
  
        &gt;&gt; if #&quot;a&quot; = first &quot;abc&quot; [print &quot;match&quot;]
        match

    ; without quotes

        &gt;&gt; first &quot;abc&quot;
        == #a

        &gt;&gt; if #a = first &quot;abc&quot; [print &quot;match&quot;]
        match

We know **`#a=b`** is different from **`#a = b`** due to whitespace significance, and it&#39;s nice to play a card from that hand here.

Of course not all characters fit the pattern, so people will hopefully be sensitive to the idea that **`#]`** is an empty token up against a bracket, and **#&quot;]&quot;** is the bracket &quot;token&quot;.  Seems learnable.

## Intuitive Similarity between #&quot;1&quot; and #1 Becomes Actual Similarity

Having TO INTEGER #&quot;1&quot; and TO INTEGER #1 act differently is just one of many examples of why this shouldn&#39;t be a difference.

## Quote Notation Opens Up Forms for &quot;ISSUE!&quot;

Before, **#&quot;a b c&quot;** was an &quot;invalid character&quot;.  Now it&#39;s a valid token.  This enables more dialect usages of a unique stringlike type.

## ...more...

It&#39;s nice being able to solve situations where you want characters in quotes for things like command lines, and can say **`&quot;char: #a&quot;`** instead of **`&quot;char: #\&quot;a\&quot;&quot;`**.  But taking the **#{}** form from BINARY! would be needed to really generalize that victory.

With tokens being generic enough to hold ANY-STRING! content, I observed that they might be able to be used in an answer for what to do when you wanted a map key to be case-sensitive.  But same-cased ISSUE! and strings haven&#39;t compared equal even in Rebol2:

    rebol2&gt;&gt; &quot;abc&quot; = #abc
    == false

This means you&#39;d have to turn your string into a token before looking it up in the map.  But since tokens are immutable, that would force your string to become read-only in that process.

It&#39;s something predicates might solve, by letting you use a different predicate for lookup than common equality.  Yet the whole premise of map lookups is that they are based on a hash function that reliably produces the same result...so if a map was hashed with one notion of lookup, you can&#39;t just pick an arbitrary function...

Anyway, there are things to think through and opportunities that this might create.  I&#39;ll be interested to see.  But already, it&#39;s a win.</description>

</aside>
<p>I thought I'd point out a cool example from the console source...where C and Ren-C are getting mixed.</p>
<p>There is a part where WORD!s are being used as virtual keycodes, and then there is C code that wants to react to those codes.  To make it clear/easy/efficient, what happens is that a Rebol SWITCH <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/93cb30376c4c8d79ec01c28c46eb9ac917ac7aed/extensions/stdio/p-stdio.c#L123" rel="nofollow noopener">translates the WORD!s into char` values</a>, that can be used in a C switch statement.</p>
<pre><code>       uint32_t ch = rebUnboxChar(
            "to char! switch", rebQ(e), "[",
                "'escape ['E]",

                "'up ['U]",
                "'down ['D]",
                "'ctrl-b",  // Backward One Character (bash)
                    "'left ['L]",
                "'ctrl-f",  // Forward One Character (bash)
                    "'right ['R]",
                ...

      switch (ch) {
          case 0:  // Ignored (e.g. unknown Ctrl-XXX)
            break;

          case 'E':  // ESCAPE
            Term_Abandon_Pending_Events(t);
            line = rebBlank();
            break;
</code></pre>
<p>You notice that previously, the branches in the switch() didn't use CHAR!.  They used WORD!s, because the escaping of chars would be too annoying.  (e.g. <code>"'escape [#\"E\"]"</code>)  So the WORD!s are translated to chars outside the switch with TO CHAR!.</p>
<p>Now using the ISSUE!s directly in the SWITCH is painless, and there's no need for the conversion:</p>
<pre><code> uint32_t ch = rebUnboxChar(
        "switch", rebQ(e), "[",
            "'escape [#E]",

            "'up [#U]",
            "'down [#D]",
            "'ctrl-b",  // Backward One Character (bash)
                "'left [#L]",
            "'ctrl-f",  // Forward One Character (bash)
                "'right [#R]",
            ...
</code></pre>
<p>It's a cool and sneaky way to push through that cross-language barrier.  Just a reminder that these design points are "deep thoughts"...not change for the sake of change!</p>
