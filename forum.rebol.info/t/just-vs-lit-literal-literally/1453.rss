    <title>JUST vs LIT/LITERAL/LITERALLY</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/just-vs-lit-literal-literally/1453</link>
    <description>Among purposes we might apply JUST for, I think it could be a better name for LIT.

Quick reminder that QUOTE means something different... it means add a generalized quoting level to the argument:

    &gt;&gt; quote 10
    == &#39;10

    &gt;&gt; x: 10

    &gt;&gt; quote x
    == &#39;10

    &gt;&gt; quote x + 20
    == &#39;30

    &gt;&gt; quote quote x
    == &#39;&#39;10

    &gt;&gt; quote/depth [a block] 3
    == &#39;&#39;&#39;[a block]

I can&#39;t think of a better name for that than QUOTE.  So what Rebol2&#39;s QUOTE did (&quot;give me the following value literally&quot;) was taken over by LITERAL.

    &gt;&gt; literal x
    == x

But when you give an operation a noun name, then it competes with when you might want a variable to hold that.  So if you have a list of &quot;literals&quot; you might say **for-each literal literals [...]**.  I had an idea to work around this by calling it LITERALLY:

    &gt;&gt; literally x
    == x

But both LITERAL and LITERALLY feel too long, so it was abbreviated as LIT:
 
    &gt;&gt; lit x
    == x

Which you can get used to, but still it&#39;s an abbreviation and not a word, so it is a bit of a wart.

Compared to all of this, JUST ticks all the boxes.

* short
* a real, un-abbreviated word
* not a noun and unlikely to be desired as a variable name

It feels very intuitive:

    &gt;&gt; just x
    == x

    &gt;&gt; quote just x
    == &#39;x

I had thought the name wouldn&#39;t matter that much since generic quoting would mean you&#39;d nearly never use it.  However, [quoting has other effects](https://forum.rebol.info/t/the-beta-one-mutability-manifesto/1062/4?u=hostilefork) which means we probably want to encourage people not to use evaluative quoting of GROUP!s/etc. unless they are sure they know what they&#39;re doing (wouldn&#39;t be any worse than historical properties, but we&#39;re trying to be better).

This tips the scales in favor of using ONLY for a block-making operation that consists of the single argument you give it, which @rgchris had warmed up to:

[quote=&quot;rgchris, post:12, topic:1182&quot;]
On reflection, I think ONLY would have been a better choice than some of my other suggestions [...]
[/quote]

    &gt;&gt; only 1000 + 20
    == [1020]

    &gt;&gt; only [d]
    == [[d]]

This creates a little bit of friction with those wishing to use /ONLY as a refinement name.  But it&#39;s not a particularly great refinement name anyway...and this problem exists for lots of words (e.g. /ALL).  [I&#39;ve posted about the need for solutions to naming refinements out of the way.](https://forum.rebol.info/t/idea-for-naming-function-arguments-out-of-the-way/1167)

---

**I&#39;ve changed over to this so we can try it out.**  No one&#39;s really gotten used to LIT anyway, and I feel pretty good about how the change to JUST looks seeing it used around in the code...so I&#39;ll see if that feeling persists.

**It is not difficult to change back.**</description>

<p><strong>It seems to me now somewhat obvious that the right name for this operator is THE.</strong></p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; the x
== x

&gt;&gt; the (1 + 2)
== (1 + 2)
</code></pre>
<p>That just clicks.  Much better than when I was considering THE as a name for ENSURE (as in Lisp)...or for the concept of "ensure non null".</p>
<p>So JUST is back in the running for being the way that single items can participate with things like FIND and APPEND when working with ANY-ARRAY!.  But in a new way...</p>
<pre><code> ; JUST X &lt;=&gt; QUOTE THE X

 &gt;&gt; the x
 == x

 &gt;&gt; quote the x
 == 'x

 &gt;&gt; just x
 == 'x
</code></pre>
<p>This helps people avoid breaking the flow of their writing when manipulating single items in block contexts:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; append [a b c] just [d e f]
== [a b c [d e f]]

&gt;&gt; append [a b c] just d
== [a b c d]
</code></pre>
<p>Remember that if you want to evaluate the argument and then quote it, you can use QUOTE.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; append [a b c] quote 1 + 2
== [a b c 3]</code></pre>

            <p>So in an interesting development, <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/emergent-behavior-of-x-x-y-x-y/1596">"LIT" now actually does mean "literal-IZE"</a>...so if anything it should be a synonym for QUOTE.  But I like [QUOTE UNQUOTE] more than [LIT UNLIT] or whatever.</p>
<p>Keeping LIT free also means you have a name for a variable holding a LIT!</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; @ 1020
== '1020

&gt;&gt; lit: first [@]
== @

&gt;&gt; type of lit
== #[datatype! lit!]

<p>If we were going for maximum clarity, I think "literally"  is the most clear:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; append [a b c] literally d
== [a b c d]
</code></pre>
<p>But no one wants to write that in practice, so the reality would be that the code would have <code>lit</code> everywhere.  So I think it's likely that JUST is a keeper.</p>
