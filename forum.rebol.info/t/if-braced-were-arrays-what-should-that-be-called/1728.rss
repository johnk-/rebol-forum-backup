    <title>If {Braced Were Arrays} What Should That Be Called</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/if-braced-were-arrays-what-should-that-be-called/1728</link>
    <description>It&#39;s early yet in the discussion of [whether to make braces a new array type](https://forum.rebol.info/t/rethinking-braces-as-an-array-type/1727).  But people seem receptive and feel like maybe Rebol has put itself in a bad position by using that particularly valuable piece of keyboard real-estate for something &quot;superficial&quot; like making strings a little cleaner, sometimes.  :-/

*(Note: Ultimately braces were decided to keep as strings, though having another array type is still a possibility...and maybe it will need a name.)*

For lack of another name I had called it BRACED!.

But I don&#39;t like that much more than I would want to call *blocks* BRACKETED! (or BRACK! :roll_eyes:)... nor call *groups* PARENTHESIZED! (or PAREN! :face_vomiting: )

Here is my suggestion for the 3 array types:

# `[block]` `•`  `(group)` `•` `{fence}`

---

I like that FENCE is five letters...matching GROUP and BLOCK.  I like that it starts with a distinct character.

**I actually think having it be divorced from anything obvious about creating objects can be seen as an asset instead of a liability.**  Because that&#39;s only what it&#39;s for *sometimes*.

* *&quot;In the PARSE dialect, blocks are used to represent subrules.  Groups switch over to running ordinary code as with DO.  While fences are used to... (insert your active imagination here)&quot;*

* *&quot;If there&#39;s an integer inside of a pair of fences, such as `{{10}}`, then that represents a citation.  Citations can appear at either the beginning or end of a reference block.&quot;*

It&#39;s one of those things that might seem a little weird at first, but as you become accustomed to saying it then it becomes normal...and you&#39;re grateful to have such a convenient word at hand.

## Other Uses of &quot;Fence&quot; in Programming
Dictionary definition of fence: *a barrier, railing, or other upright structure, typically of wood or wire, enclosing an area of ground to mark a boundary, control access, or prevent escape.*

The term *fence* has only two meanings in programming that jump immediately to mind...the one most people would know are these three-backticks used to format code in MarkDown:

    When you are writing things in **MarkDown**
    The following is a &quot;code fence&quot;
    ```
    int main(int argc, char *argv) {
        printf(&quot;I&#39;m not a huge fan of the ```, myself.\n&quot;);
        return EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }
    ```
    *(I myself prefer to indent by 4 spaces, instead.)*

Less well-known to the scripting world would be &quot;fencing instructions&quot; which are low-level processor stuff used to mitigate things like Spectre.

## Other Options?

**{ CURLY! }** is too goofy, immediate veto from me.

I&#39;ve explained why I don&#39;t like **{ BRACE! }** or **{ BRACED! }**.  Plus brace has the problem of being singular like PAREN!, while BRACED! seems to talk about the *contents* vs. the actual structure of the container itself...which I guess might have to be &quot;bracing&quot; or &quot;braces&quot; or something.  FENCE! lets you mentally model it as actually referring to &quot;the container in and of itself&quot;.

For terms that relate to &quot;contained things&quot; there might be the likes of **{ CLAUSE! }**...but that feels a bit more prescriptive to what it&#39;s for.  And object-making doesn&#39;t line up with that.  FENCE! is more abstract to me, somehow.

One could argue that **{ CLUSTER }** might sound more like an array that produced an object.  (&quot;Hey, cluster these keys together, into a blob.&quot;)  You might similarly argue for **{ AGGREGATE! }** as being &quot;more meaningful&quot;.

But I&#39;m drawn to the viscerality of FENCE!.  It feels learnable within this vocabulary.  Especially when you see it lined up with GROUP! and BLOCK!.  I&#39;m kind of attached to it now.  :two_hearts:</description>

            <p><b><i>SEQUENCE</i></b></p>
<p>Give it some thought for a moment... And?...</p>
<p>A data type that, like a Rebol function can take parameters in doubles: key/value pair, or just keys as in a list with or without [type!] . Something like Uparse could be its constructor.</p>
<p>Most programming languages use a sequence data type, but its usually homogeneous.</p>
<p>Ours would be heterogeneous, serialized(molded), and based on its delimitation, you or it can choose its data structure type.<br>
ARRAY..DICTIONARY..ENUM..<br>
STRUCTURE..MAP..JSON..etc.</p>
<p>This would allow us to pull theres in and push ours out without many changes.</p>
<p>We could also have the convenience of not loading but still Reboling away on it some what safely.</p>
<p><b><i>This can work.</i></b></p>
<p>Take a look at Euphorias' sequence type. Rebol is allready there. It just needs a R/S, VM, Ren-C, EU, C, or plain old Rebol Dialect parser.</p>
<p>I put together the %Rebol-Dom.r and its Mdlparser.r just for this purpose.</p>

    Old post, but new-old thoughts. 
Pack is a very good name but I've decided in relationship to a Dialect Object Model it should simply be an element-node of type Sequence. 
Used as a variable set-word, the array-obj!() uses the sequence as a set-builder notation. 
Its base form is serialized data thats  represented in Rebol as molded data. 
Its grouping order is {[()]}, but not necessarily followed in dialects. And in Rebol there is no difference in using "{}" or "[]", unless your sending, receiv…

<p>It's just my way of prototyping the Sequence idea.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents worth of thoughts.</p>
