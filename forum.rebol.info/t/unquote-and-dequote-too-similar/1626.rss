    <title>UNQUOTE and DEQUOTE too similar</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/unquote-and-dequote-too-similar/1626</link>
    <description>I created two separate terms regarding removing quoting levels.

One was unquote, e.g. it removes one level:

     &gt;&gt; unquote first [&#39;&#39;&#39;a]
     == &#39;&#39;a

It has a /DEPTH refinement where you can say how many levels to remove (so the default depth is 1).  If there aren&#39;t enough levels it will error.

The other operation was DEQUOTE, which would remove all the quoting levels...it would not complain if something was not quoted:

     &gt;&gt; dequote first [&#39;&#39;&#39;a]
     == a

     &gt;&gt; dequote first [a]
     == a

**I&#39;ve messed this up a lot and used the word DEQUOTE where I meant to say UNQUOTE.** So those words are too close to each other.  There&#39;s really no great argument for why the meanings wouldn&#39;t be the same or swapped.  (e.g. &quot;Why would something called UNQUOTE return a thing that still has quotes on it?&quot;)

Regardless of any counter-arguments, I do feel that UNQUOTE makes sense at the end of the day as removing one level of quote.

A refinement to UNQUOTE as something like UNQUOTE/FULLY (more descriptive) or UNQUOTE/ALL (shorter at the cost of clarity) might work:

    &gt;&gt; unquote/fully first [&#39;&#39;&#39;a]
    == a

But it&#39;s always a bit unpleasing when you offer refinements that can&#39;t be mixed, like /DEPTH and /FULLY would be incompatible.

Also I think this might be kind of a common operation, to ask for the non-quoted essence of a value.

Perhaps NONQUOTED?

    &gt;&gt; nonquoted first [&#39;&#39;&#39;a]
    == a

But I had aimed that QUOTED and such would be *type modifiers*, so QUOTED INTEGER! would give you a datatype representing quoted integers.

While all this makes me feel a bit more like excusing DEQUOTE, I have made too many mistakes mixing them up, and if I make them then other people certainly will...</description>

<p>You could think about noquote.</p>

</aside>
<p>NOQUOTE is an interesting option.</p>
<p>I've mentioned that UNQUOTED and QUOTED are modifiers I thought would only take types.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; integer!
== @[integer]

&gt;&gt; type of first ['10]
== @['integer]

&gt;&gt; quoted integer!
== @['integer]
</code></pre>
<p>This would be a different operation with narrower uses.</p>
<p>But NOQUOTE is the same part of speech as UNQUOTE, and the same number of letters.  So might be a better choice than trying to make something a different part of speech even if it's a "more English looking" word like NONQUOTED.</p>
<p>Might try it for a while and see how it feels.</p>

            <p>You could think about noquote.<br>
Unquote (quote unquote) and dequote are quite similar and dequote could better remove all quote levels because of the above.  Now also UNQUOTED can mean leave no quotes.</p>
