    <title>FFI Updates and Notes</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/ffi-updates-and-notes/1201</link>
    <description>Due to some complexities that had to do with the build system, the Ren-C FFI extension ceased being buildable somewhere on Dec 8, 2018.

Despite that, it still got some maintenance.  So when things were being searched and replaced in the codebase at large, I would tinker with the code in the FFI a bit to try and make it roughly reflect what had changed.  But even with that, a year&#39;s worth of drift without running it means it&#39;s going to get out of date.

In the last two days I&#39;ve been able to get the demos back in running condition...including @szeng&#39;s GTK demo:

## Cool, but the Build Problems Haven&#39;t Gone Away...

There hasn&#39;t been a lot of time to focus on making Rebmake better at cross-platform inclusion of libraries that aren&#39;t by default available on the platform.  There&#39;s no libffi that ships in Visual Studio, so it becomes something of a manual configuration process.  Also, there&#39;s a bit of configuring that has to be done to get it working in cross-compilation of 32-bit binaries on a 64-bit Linux host.  Similar difficulties for OS X.

Since no one is currently actively using the FFI (in the Ren-C builds at least), it seems the path of least resistance is to just have it building into the 64-bit Linux builds.  That&#39;s where it&#39;s easy for the Travis container to install the package with **sudo apt-get libffi** and link with a simple **`-lffi`**.  This is enough to keep the code compiling and run a couple of little smoke tests to make sure things haven&#39;t gone too far south.

**To be clear: if you have the libraries all set up, then a &quot;sufficiently motivated individual&quot; could get the OS X, 32-bit Linux, and Windows versions to build.**  There&#39;s nothing about the *code* that shouldn&#39;t work (since it works on Linux 64-bit, it&#39;s more or less proven.)  But they&#39;d have to massage Rebmake to get it to spit out the right command lines and find the right files on the right platforms, when they&#39;re not around by default.  It shouldn&#39;t be too hard, as the package setup code was already on Travis...but Rebmake is a bit of a beast and needs some design work vs. just hacking it up more.

## Speaking of Tests...

I&#39;ve been wanting tests that are extension-specific to live in the directory with the extension.  So I&#39;m moving them.  Right now we have:

* **`%printf.r`** - Very simple demonstration of calling printf
* **`%varargs.r`** - More complex examples of calling printf and sprintf 
* **`%qsort.r`** - Simple callback example of C&#39;s `qsort()` function, where the sorting comparison function used by the C code is actually a Rebol function. 
* **`%qsort_r.r`** - More complex example of C&#39;s `qsort_r()` function, that allows passing a value through to the internal function that is not a global variable.  Also makes that value a &quot;tunneled&quot; REBVAL*, so you can actually pass a Rebol value to the C as a pointer and then get it back in the Rebol callback as a REBVAL again.
* **`%gtk.r`** - Gtk demo with toggle button, push button, font picker, and color picker

There was one file hanging around called `%varargs_old.r`.  In Atronix R3 there were no variadics, so the only way to do something like printf was with a block.  This means you&#39;d have to COMPOSE or REDUCE to get your values in:

    printf compose [
        &quot;hello %p%c&quot;
        &quot;ffi&quot; [pointer]
        (to integer! newline) [int8]
    ]

With variadics in Ren-C there was the variadic option, so I changed it to try it.  For instance:

    (printf &quot;hello %p%c&quot; &quot;ffi&quot; [pointer] to integer! newline [int8])

You could also use an expression barrier:

    printf &quot;hello %p%c&quot; &quot;ffi&quot; [pointer] to integer! newline [int8] |

I don&#39;t know what the &quot;right&quot; answer for calling C variadics is.  Maybe the compose was better?  But it&#39;s easy enough to go back and forth that I don&#39;t think we need to preserve two copies of the same file to different conventions.  Hence, instead I&#39;m making a note here.

## And as I mentioned in chat...

The big crazy difference with this FFI from the Atronix R3 is that it&#39;s all an extension. If you look closely you&#39;ll see a bit of an oddity in that it says  **make custom!**  and not  **make struct!** . :-/ There needs to be some work on that particular ecology point.

The  *mechanics*  of having an arbitrary number of datatypes is now in place. So the system is no longer limited to the number of types that fit in a byte...only the built-in types use that for optimization to get use out of all 3 platform pointers (besides the pointer-sized bits used for the header). But a REB_CUSTOM type means that it is sacrificing one of those pointers in the cell for the extension type.

So...there&#39;s now a bunch of policy and ecology to straighten out on top of that.

But again, the good news of all of this is that it means that we aren&#39;t stuck putting a bunch of FFI-specific code in the core; so the WASM build can be lighter. And similarly, we don&#39;t have a bunch of JavaScript support in the core. So things are factoring well for using the language in different configurations.</description>
