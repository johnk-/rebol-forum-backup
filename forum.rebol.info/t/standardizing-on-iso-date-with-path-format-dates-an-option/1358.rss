    <title>Standardizing on ISO Date, with PATH!-format Dates an Option?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/standardizing-on-iso-date-with-path-format-dates-an-option/1358</link>
    <description>So I&#39;ve really only ever used DATE! once.  And that one time I did use it, I had to convert it to an ISO date and timestamp.

In a mostly-unrelated PR, the thing @giuliolunati, @LkpPo, and @IngoHohmann [all seemed to bring up](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/pull/1080#pullrequestreview-503244215) would be that ISO date format support would be a good thing. 

## A New Option: PATH! for dates

So syntax-wise, there&#39;s nothing stopping you from making the PATH! **`12/Dec/2012`** if you want.  (Well...or the tuple **`2012.Dec.12`**, if you felt like it...then you could combine it in a PATH! with something else, maybe a TIME!  **2012.Dec.12/0:00**...though TIME! is currently illegal in PATH!)

Anyway, PATH!s present a fairly reasonable LOAD-able format for dialects that wanted them...that you wouldn&#39;t have to put in quotes.  Their TYPE OF wouldn&#39;t be DATE!, but you could work with them structurally.  Then you could convert them to and from the ISO dates.

I don&#39;t know enough of the issues to know exactly what all would be entailed in ISO dates.  One theoretical benefit might be being able to use a vetted date library for arithmetic.

**Reply here with concrete examples that contrast how DATE! works today and how you might imagine it working in an alternative more-ISO-friendly way.**</description>

            <p>For me it's just about being able to handle dates in iso format well.<br>
Funnily 2020-10-20/12:30:00 is valid according to rfc3339 and can be handled by Rebol. (For it to be iso compliant the "/" would have to be changed to "T".)<br>
And I would like the standard date output to be iso compliant, not something I guess no-one really uses.</p>
