    <description>Barry Walsh, Freelance IT Consultant from London, UK.  Stalwart from Market Research industry! Escaped briefly into Management Consultancy and then a failed web CRM start-up before going solo with [Draegtun Systems Ltd](http://www.draegtun.com)

Self taught programmer using mixture of proprietary languages until I discovered Perl in 1995.  This was my first introduction to an opensource [community](https://metacpan.org/author/DRAEGTUN).  With Perl I developed a websurvey system used on one of the largest continual surveys.

First came across Rebol when it was opensourced on 12-12-2012 via a HN article.  I think dialects and parse is what attracted me most to the language.   

Most development I do now uses Rebol 3.   And I&#39;ve used Cheyenne on last few web projects.
