    <title>JS testing with Cypress.io</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/js-testing-with-cypress-io/1778</link>
    <description>I will eventually have to port my Red GUI database front end and so I was looking for testing tools.  I came across https://cypress.io which seems to be fully featured though it may be more demanding of JS knowledge than I have.

Anyway, here&#39;s a short script to open up the replpad, and start the chess demo though I had to increase the default timeout from 4 to 5 seconds

&gt; describe(&#39;Test the replpad&#39;, () =&gt; {
&gt;   it(&#39;Visits Replpad&#39;, () =&gt; {
&gt;     cy.visit(`&#39;http://hostilefork.com/media/shared/replpad-js/&#39;`)
&gt;     cy.get(&#39;.input&#39;).type(&#39;do &amp;lt;chess&amp;gt;{enter}&#39;)
&gt;   })
&gt; })

So, it opens a browser instance to the replpad, waits until loading is complete, and then waits until the dom has the `.input` element present.  It then types the chess command.  The chess board then pops up.

Here&#39;s a quick [tutorial](https://filiphric.com/cypress-basics-selecting-elements) on how to select elements.

Installation is just simply

    npm install cypress --save-dev

but of course on Windows, you&#39;ll need to install node.js

And there&#39;s [information](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/continuous-integration/github-actions#Basic-Setup) on how to use with GitHub actions</description>
