          <p>Today I hit something that was a bit of an annoyance.  I couldn't use our fun "BLANK!-in-NULL-out convention" with SET.</p>
<p>So instead of:</p>
<pre><code>set try my-variable-that-may-be-null value
</code></pre>
<p>I had to write:</p>
<pre><code>if my-variable-that-may-be-null [
    set my-variable-that-may-be-null value
]
</code></pre>
<p>How irritating this is depends on the length of the variable name.  Though it's irritating even if it's one letter.</p>
<p>The reason we have this situation is because we are honoring a concept that was put forth early in the days of so-called "none propagation", where BrianH and others believed that mutating operations should not let you "opt out".  There was too much potential for confusion if you wrote <strong>append block [1 2 3]</strong> and it silently didn't append, because block was a NONE!:</p>
<pre><code>r3-alpha&gt;&gt; block: none
r3-alpha&gt;&gt; append block [1 2 3]
** Script error: append does not allow none! for its series argument

red&gt;&gt; block: none
red&gt;&gt; append block [1 2 3]
*** Script Error: append does not allow none! for its series argument
</code></pre>
<p>Operations without side effects were deemed to be harmless by comparison:</p>
<pre><code>r3-alpha&gt;&gt; block: none
r3-alpha&gt;&gt; select block 'a
== none

red&gt;&gt; block: none
red&gt;&gt; select block 'a
== none
</code></pre>
<p>But even that had a kind of nasty property.  You could write a long chain of non-mutating operations, and at the end of the pipe you could get a NONE! without knowing where in that pipe the error occurred.  <em>(All of this compounded on the fact that a NONE! could have even literally been something that was selected, so your opt-out value could have been an actual selection result!)</em></p>
<h2>NULL as "Soft Failure" Provided Error Locality</h2>
<p><a href="../null-blank-void-history-under-scrutiny/1249.html"><strong>This gave rise to Ren-C's BLANK!-in, NULL out philosophy.</strong></a>  It offers better error locality, by making opt-out tolerant constructs give back something that they themselves wouldn't take as a valid input.  Then, TRY could be used to convert those "soft failure" NULLs into BLANK!s...putting documentation and intent on where tolerance was desired:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; block: blank
== _

&gt;&gt; select block 'a
; null

&gt;&gt; select (select block 'a) 'b
** Script Error: select requires series argument to not be null

&gt;&gt; try select block 'a
== _

&gt;&gt; select (try select block 'a) 'b
; null
</code></pre>
<p>The convention was considered to possibly be a way of dealing with soft failures in arithmetic, <a href="../blank-in-null-out-convention-vs-logic-returning-actions/954.html">in places where "Not-a-Number"</a> had propagated before.</p>
<p>This created a fairly significant paradigm shift, where it didn't make sense to use BLANK!s in common places...such as unused refinements.  <em>They could carry meaning,</em> a conscious desire to opt-out.  This was different from a NULL.</p>
<h2>Does "friendly" NULL reframe things by making BLANK! rarer?</h2>
<p>If BLANK!s are relatively rare, and not used by people willy-nilly where NULL should be used...then what are we saving by not letting operations like SET and APPEND opt-out with BLANK!?</p>
<p>One thing is that if we consider the concrete issue of working with BLOCK!s, you can't put a NULL in that block, only a BLANK!</p>
<pre><code> obj: make object! [x: 10 y: null z: 'word]
 data: [x: 10 y: _ z: word]
</code></pre>
<p>It's all fine and well to imagine saying <strong>append obj/y [a b c]</strong> and getting an error.  But the block doesn't have that luxury.  So it's sketchy to imagine saying <strong>append data/y [a b c]</strong> and having it silently keep running without warning you.</p>
<p>But when I talk about issues like <a href="../block-and-object-parity-in-pathing-picking/1086.html">parity in object and path picking</a>, it might be that parity comes from "scant" evaluation.  e.g. everything is processed at one quote level, unless it has no quotes.</p>
<pre><code> obj: make object! [x: 10 y: null z: 'word]
 data: [x: 10 y: ' z: 'word]
</code></pre>
<p>So when you ask for <strong>data/y</strong> you get null back, and <strong>data/z</strong> you get <code>word</code> back but <strong>data/x</strong> gives 10.</p>
<p><em>But that single apostrophe looks pretty odd.</em>  Note that we could decide that single-apostrophe renders differently... it likely shouldn't be #[null] as that is misleading (you can't have a null in a block).  But it could be #[nullify] or something of that sort to say that if it gets <em>evaluated</em> it will become a null.</p>
<p>But we could spin this around and say that <em>it is BLANK! itself that evaluates to null, but a variable that is blank evaluates to blank</em>.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; x: _
; null

&gt;&gt; x
; null

&gt;&gt; x: '_
== _

&gt;&gt; x
== _

&gt;&gt; x: blank
== _

&gt;&gt; x
== _
</code></pre>
<p>That would make <code>_</code> a shorthand for a single tick <code>'</code> when used in evaluative contexts.  This might make the "scant evaluation" I describe more appealing, which may help with the OBJECT! &lt;=&gt; BLOCK! parity initiative.</p>
<p>(This proposal should not be mistaken for a previously panned "wacky" proposal: that <a href="../should-append-null-fail-append-blank-add-nothing-unless-only/635/5.html">looking up a variable that was BLANK! evaluated to NULL</a>.  We don't believe in "decay" of this form, e.g. the infamous "lit-word decay" from Rebol2 and R3-Alpha that Red also got rid of.)</p>
<h2>Just Thinking Aloud...</h2>
<p>As I said at the top of the post, I think it would be nice if we could opt-out of APPEND or SET in a chain of operations...as we do with non-mutating operations.  I just want to look at it from all the angles, as this jigsaw puzzle comes together.</p>
<p>Note I did not originate the term "scant" evaluation--that was a term that originated in CONSTRUCT:</p>
<pre><code>r3-alpha&gt;&gt; help construct
USAGE:
    CONSTRUCT block /with object /only

DESCRIPTION:
    Creates an object with scant (safe) evaluation.
    CONSTRUCT is a native value.

ARGUMENTS:
    block -- Specification (modified) (block! string! binary!)

REFINEMENTS:
     /with -- Default object
         object (object!)
     /only -- Values are kept as-is</code></pre>
