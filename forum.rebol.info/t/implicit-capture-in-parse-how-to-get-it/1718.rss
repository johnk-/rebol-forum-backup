    <title>Implicit Capture In PARSE - How To Get It?</title>

    <description>ISO-8601 dates are very close to Rebol dates, but just different enough to make it a pain.

Are Rebol dates more readable?  Yes.  Are they so much better as to make it worthwhile to buck the standard?  :man_shrugging:  Are they in conflict with generalized PATH! representation?  :man_shrugging: 

## Nevermind, This Post Is About Something Else

Let&#39;s say I just want to capture the YEAR, the MONTH, and the DAY out of an ISO-8601 date.

    uparse isodate [
        year: between &lt;here&gt; &quot;-&quot;
        month: between &lt;here&gt; &quot;-&quot;
        day: between &lt;here&gt; &quot;T&quot;
        ...
     ]

Despite having BETWEEN, it&#39;s laborious.  *(Historical Rebol needs `copy to &quot;-&quot;` followed by a SKIP, even more convoluted).*

It needs a shorthand.  We have TAG! at our disposal, still:

    uparse isodate [year: &lt;*&gt; &quot;-&quot; month: &lt;*&gt; &quot;-&quot; day: &lt;*&gt; &quot;T&quot; ...]

And it could be plain **`*`**:

    uparse isodate [year: *, &quot;-&quot;, month: *, &quot;-&quot;, day: *, &quot;T&quot;, ...]


But I kind of find myself wishing for another lexical type that means &quot;capture&quot;.  I&#39;d thought about this as being the meaning of `@xxx` before the current interpretation.

I&#39;m nearly certain we&#39;ll have **$word**, **$[bl o ck]**, **$(gr o up)** and friends.  Maybe that?

    uparse isodate [$year &quot;-&quot; $month &quot;-&quot; $day &quot;T&quot; ...]

Though since the general meaning would be &quot;get-environment-variable&quot; this would raise questions about dialects bending the meaning of things so severely.

## It Feels Weak To Not Have An Answer For This

Other parsing systems will always seem like they have an edge if there isn&#39;t a shorthand for this &quot;capture until the next rule&quot;.</description>
