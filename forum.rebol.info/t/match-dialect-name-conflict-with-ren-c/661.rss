    <title>MATCH dialect (name conflict with Ren-C)</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/match-dialect-name-conflict-with-ren-c/661</link>
    <description>Ren-C&#39;s MATCH is a [powerful variadic filtering function](https://trello.com/c/LR9PzUS3/125-match-filters-values-based-on-type-tests-or-arbitrary-function-filters) for values, which can even let you just call the filter function on an argument while extracting that argument as the result:

    &gt;&gt; match parse &quot;aaa&quot; [some &quot;a&quot;]
    == &quot;aaa&quot; ;-- whoa! how&#39;d it do that? &gt;:-)

In any case, that name conflicts with MATCH in QuarterMaster, which is different:

    match [&quot;three&quot; two 1] [
        one: integer!
        two: opt &#39;two
        three: some string!
        four: any issue!
    ]
    == make object! [
        one: 1
        two: &#39;two
        three: [&quot;three&quot;]
        four: _ ;-- e.g. none
    ]

This seems [a lot like DELECT](https://github.com/revault/rebol-wiki/wiki/Delect), which was discussed recently.  I&#39;d be interested to understand the differences, and if the two could be merged.  If so, I think it would probably be good to change the name to not conflict with Ren-C&#39;s MATCH, because that is something I think people are really going to want to use (once they realize how great it is!)  :-)

            <p>There's more documentation for <em>delect</em> and in the wild use so I'd suggest keeping the name, and renaming QM's match.</p>

            <p>Naming of functions like this is a problem. With 'match I think of two things that do or do not match, that can be there are equal or they do share some common ability.<br>
DELECT afaik does not exist as a true word in English. DEcode diaLECT. What it is doing, as I understand it, like your 'match also, is kind of (re)ordering the arguments.<br>
I suggest that the name of this (or the new) function reflects more this behaviour.<br>
Some suggestions are REORDER CATALOG CODIFY LINE-UP<br>
