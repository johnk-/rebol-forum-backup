    <title>Command Line Parameters in the Rebol Universe</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/command-line-parameters-in-the-rebol-universe/517</link>
    <description>@giuliolunati made an [interesting change recently](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/commit/92fae0a9baa6e20d33f77b9788b65e04bfddc285) to the %make.r process in which it would allow you to use **param: value** instead of **param=value** on the command line.

One of the motivations was auto-completion in shells.  If you have your cursor `_` sitting at the end of something, so **r3 foob_** and hit tab, it will complete to `r3 foobar.txt`.  But if you have **r3 param=foob_** you will not get this behavior.

So breaking it up has a benefit there (as long as your command line processing doesn&#39;t require a `%` on filenames, because completion in shells like bash won&#39;t work with that).

---

**Question #1**: *Do we need to support both synaxes in %make.r*?  I say no...we are already fighting quite a lot of complexity, and that means more code as well as more variations in documentation.  Given that it is friendlier to autocomplete I suggest we adopt @giuliolunati&#39;s method--unless anyone can think of a good reason not to.

This raises some questions, however, about things like `--help`.  Presumably we don&#39;t want `help: yes` to be how you ask for HELP.  But to go with a more Rebol-like syntax, a refinement e.g. `/help` could be more sensible, in the same way that `a: b` makes more sense than `a=b` for assigning a parameter value.

---

**Question #2**: *Beyond the special-purpose %make.r...for which we can use whatever rules are most convenient...should the interpreter itself use more of a LOAD-able syntax in general?  What about best practices for Rebol command line apps?*

In its own command line, Rebol already avoids using `=`, so it&#39;s **--do &quot;print {Hi}&quot;** and not **--do=&quot;print {Hi}&quot;**.  This isn&#39;t done for LOAD-ability, though it similarly makes parsing a little bit easier.

Here&#39;s some background reading on people&#39;s ideas about best practices for command lines.  Unsurprisingly, the suggestions are &quot;be consistent with everything else&quot;, so they advocate for supporting --help and --version, the -- to end options and start formal arguments, etc.:

I don&#39;t know about all the nuances, but as this stuff is now usermode code it offers the opportunity to experiment with different ideas.</description>
