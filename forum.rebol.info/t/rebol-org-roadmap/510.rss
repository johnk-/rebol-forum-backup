    <title>Rebol.org Roadmap</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/rebol-org-roadmap/510</link>
    <description>I have added the [Roadmap](http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/roadmap) mockup now, and I was wondering if you like the design and layout of the page? You will need to view it on a desktop / laptop screen. It doesn&#39;t display nicely on mobile right now, but that can always be fixed. I just wanted to get some first impressions before I spent more time on it.

Also, I understand you may not want to list dates here, and so they could be removed. And instead of displaying the year in the circle, it could be something like a checkbox icon, and it gets checked when a milestone has been reached.

Let me know your thoughts, thanks!</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The roadmap page has been updated to support the new Markdown structure now.</p>
<p>Nothing new to see, but internally it just means you don't have to mess with any HTML to add / update items.</p>

            <p>Now Carl has published a new blog article and mentions on the <a href="http://rebol.com" rel="nofollow noopener">rebol.com</a> site he wants volunteers for shaping the <a href="http://rebol.com" rel="nofollow noopener">rebol.com</a> and volunteers for <a href="http://rebol.org" rel="nofollow noopener">rebol.org</a>.<br>
The efforts from the volunteers working on exactly that point here are unnoticed or ignored.<br>
Will there be a response from this community toward Carl?<br>
(Or does nobody expect an answer anyway?)</p>

</aside>
<p>Since dates have been taken off this can work for that.  It could just be roughly in order of how they are to be done.  Perhaps the box could have a progress meter and % complete in it, though as you say, how would this get updated?</p>
<p>Perhaps this page could be driven from a Trello of work items, e.g. one stack of cards could be the stack displayed here, and they could have checklists and the progress would be how many checks are done.</p>

            <p>I made some updates to the <a href="http://reboldocs.brianotto.com/roadmap" rel="nofollow noopener">Roadmap</a> page.</p>
<ul>
<li>replaced the Years with a checkmark icon (for completed) and a pulse icon (for in progress)</li>
<li>added some historical tasks that have already been completed (I just added a random date, since I don't know the correct one)</li>
<li>shrunk the size of the boxes a little</li>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I guess it depends how much text we actually want to add for each roadmap milestone. If we plan on writing a full page article for each one, then yea linking to a new page would be better. Otherwise, if it's just a couple sentances then the current format should suffice. If it's somewhere inbetween the two extremes, then opening a modal I think would make sense.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yea, completely understandable. I will change the mockup to show checkmarks instead and include a few that are already done, so we can see what that looks like.</p>

<p>I would very much appreciate that change, though you are free to put dates on website release goals... (!)</p>
<p>If people were involved and willing to promise and commit their time to development, and reaching certain goals by certain times, I could get behind that.  Until that happens, it's going to have to be treated as a hobby-time project, so I reserve the right to run off and join the circus at any moment if I am so inclined.  <img src="//forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=7" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  When other people start making promises, I might change perspective.</p>
<p>It would be nice if we could have a few points on the roadmap that were crossed off, just to show a near term history of what has been happening.  Maybe those could have dates on them, inside the boxes.</p>
