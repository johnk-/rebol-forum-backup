    <description>Brett Handley, studied Math and Computing at Uni and got paid for applications development in Investment Management, Property, Accounting and Manufacturing job scheduling software.

Got interested in Rebol around 2000, now my brain is ruined because I think terms of Rebol and get caught up with obscure ideas such as parsing and Rebol expression evaluation.

Still hoping to use Rebol to create apps seamlessly on mobile and desktop.</description>
