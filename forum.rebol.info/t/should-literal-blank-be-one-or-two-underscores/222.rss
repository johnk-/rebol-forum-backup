    <title>Should literal BLANK! be one, or two underscores?</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/should-literal-blank-be-one-or-two-underscores/222</link>
    <description>@rgchris suggested something that had already run across my mind a few times.  Are BLANK! literals a bit too thin at just one character wide?

Underscore is a very slight character in the first place.   Two characters would make it stand out, and be the same width as empty block or a void-evaluating group:

    data: __
    rule: []
    void: ()

Compare with:

    data: _
    rule: []
    void: ()

Is there something intrinsically more pleasing about the two underscores?  Does it resolve some of the qualms some people (@rgchris in particular) have had about the single underscore?

Or could blank be any number of underscores (defaulting to some value) and retain it as part of its formatting?  :-/

    &gt;&gt; x: _
    &gt;&gt; y: __
    &gt;&gt; z: ___

    &gt;&gt; mold x
    _

    &gt;&gt; mold y
    __

    &gt;&gt; mold z
    ___

Problem being of course that BLANK!s are generated by the system a lot; standardization makes more sense.

For near term compatibility, if _ went back to being a WORD!, we could define:

    _: __

Rebmu will of course want the ability to express a BLANK! in a single character.  :-)  So perhaps this would remain as a definition for everyone, but it should probably not be considered a literal if it is not &quot;canonized&quot;</description>

<p>The use of issues for Prebol/Red macros is somewhat a departure from their raison d'être, but not wholly egregious. However assuming that metalanguage is their primary purpose and appropriating them as such is a programmers' conceit. The semantic representation of issued strings is useful, and with not too much of a stretch aligns with IDs in HTML and hashtags in social media. Viewed through the lens of Rebol as a messaging language (as opposed to a programming language), issues contain much of what was described as <a href="http://www.rebol.com/article/0108.html#section-0.3" rel="nofollow noopener">implied semantics</a>.</p>
<p>(also too as a slight digression, <a href="http://www.rebol.com/article/0108.html#section-0.4" rel="nofollow noopener">this point</a> is why Rebol's syntax and grammar needs to be considered apart from most every other scripting language)</p>

            <p>I also prefer just single blank mainly for same reasons <span class="mention">@ShixinZeng</span> gave.</p>
<p>However for an alternative solution then how about <code>#_</code></p>
<p>Because this then follows on nicely to having literal TRUE / FALSE...</p>
<pre><code>blank: #_
true:  #true
false: #false
</code></pre>
<p>And if not enough savings are perceived over <code>#[true]</code> &amp; <code>#[false]</code> then these can be shortened (or have aliases) to <code>#T</code> &amp; <code>#F</code></p>
<p>PS. I know this is stepping further onto ISSUE! datatype but we already have <a href="http://www.rebol.com/docs/sdk/prebol.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Prebol</a>,  <a href="https://github.com/saphirion/include" rel="nofollow noopener">Include</a> &amp; <a href="https://doc.red-lang.org/en/preprocessor.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Red macros</a> doing this!</p>

            <p><span class="mention">@ShixinZeng</span> has brought up a good point about fonts.  Namely that not all fonts that have underscore will tie the two together with no gap.  He prefers one blank.</p>
<p>We've also had <a class="mention" href="/u/asampal">@asampal</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/kealist">@kealist</a> weigh in on the issue on the side of one blank.</p>
<p>It has been a conflicted issue for me, but it seems there are fairly solid arguments...combined with some intuition, for sticking with the status quo.  <img src="//forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png?v=7" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">  But FWIW, I don't think it's been that bad.  And other languages <a href="https://prime.haskell.org/wiki/Underscore" rel="nofollow noopener">like Haskell</a> have gotten away with it, and I don't think anyone freaks out too much about it.</p>
<p>Syntax highlighting can probably help out here for those who think there's a visibility problem.  I know some editors even let you do character replacement when rendering.  Unicode has something called <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/ff3f/index.htm" rel="nofollow noopener">"fullwidth low line"</a>: ＿ which is wider than _...so perhaps a syntax rule for lone underscores could substitute that?</p>
<p>I guess it's just a question.  <a class="mention" href="/u/rgchris">@rgchris</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/brett">@Brett</a>, as you warm up to blank, is it "so bad" as it is, singly?</p>

            <p>As I was expressing that single underscore is easily overlooked, I should be happy. I don't have production ready code, so changes like this do not affect me much, but others do, so I think the burden to those who have to update should be considered.</p>

<p>I mentioned that the main problem with this is that the system will generate them.  And the ones the system generate need to have a standard width...so allowing users to vary beyond that seems to introduce a variance we don't really need.  If it preserves the width, it becomes "data-bearing" and people can use it for information (e.g. <strong>length-of mold my-blank)</strong>, which is the kind of thing I'd like to avoid.  If it throws away the width, the person who made it a specific width for what-they-thought-was-a-reason will be unhappy.</p>
<p>If we've decided there's a best width--which appears to be two--there is value in asking people to standardize on that.</p>

<p>Well, _ for blank was only introduced within the past year.  So...</p>
<p>In any case, when it comes to your code--since you are likely the first person who is going to be "shipping" code to users--it should embody the best principles we've worked out, to be showcases.  I think the single underscore is indeed too slight, and things would look better with two.</p>

<p>This has been on my mind pretty much consistently since the beginning of BLANK!.  Since <a class="mention" href="/u/rgchris">@rgchris</a> brought it up on his own as well, and you agree too, and <a class="mention" href="/u/gchiu">@gchiu</a>'s only objection is "I have to change code"...I think we are looking at something that needs to happen.</p>
