    <title>Website Color Theming</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/website-color-theming/506</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve mentioned that my concept of being &quot;showy&quot; for Rebol is to try and really make it about the code, and to stick to a near-typewriter aesthetic.  Here&#39;s a suggested starting theme modification for code samples:

    pre .str, code .str { color: #000000; } /* string  - black */
    pre .kwd, code .kwd { color: #000000; } /* keyword - black */
    pre .typ, code .typ { color: #000000; } /* type - black */
    pre .lit, code .lit { color: #000000; } /* literal - black */
    pre .pun, code .pun { color: #000000; } /* punctuation - black */
    pre .pln, code .pln { color: #000000; } /* plaintext - black */
    pre .tag, code .tag { color: #000000; } /* html/xml tag - black */
    pre .atn, code .atn { color: #000000; } /* html/xml attribute name - black */
    pre .atv, code .atv { color: #000000; } /* html/xml attribute value - black */
    pre .dec, code .dec {
        font-weight: bold; color: #000000; /* dec (declaration?) - black and bold */
    }
    pre .com, code .com {
        color: #707080; font-style: italic; /* comment - gray ok if still dark */
    }

    pre.prettyprint, code.prettyprint {
    	background-color: #FFFEFE; /* white or real close to white */
    	-moz-border-radius: 8px;
    	-webkit-border-radius: 8px;
    	-o-border-radius: 8px;
    	-ms-border-radius: 8px;
    	-khtml-border-radius: 8px;
    	border-radius: 8px;
    }

I&#39;ve mentioned some of the reasons why I believe this is the way to go--beyond my personal dislike of making one&#39;s code look like it has circus colors:

* In a language with no keywords, colorizing &quot;keywords&quot; does not make sense.

* Sticking to black and white helps show off the work done to try and reduce visual noise.  That message gets lost when you add...visual noise.

* The stated goal of the language is to be readable and editable without an IDE--and be pleasant to look at and work with in that state.  I think other principles (like sticking to 80 columns, however &quot;archaic&quot; that may sound) is a good guideline as well.

* Matches the logo and the theme, lets color be used more strategically elsewhere on the site vs becoming something you have to &quot;tune out&quot;.

The one most critical thing to highlight, IMO, is the bolding of the SET-WORD!s and SET-PATH!s to further call them out...separating definitions and references.  I think that comments being a slightly-less-dark-shade, and maybe even italic, could be all right.

If this is generally accepted as the idea for the base theme (perhaps permitting a browser cookie or something to change themes if later ones are invented) then I think that helps when answering broad structure questions about contrast on the rest of the site, how to get balance of black and white regions, etc.</description>

<p>Great!  I think it looks <em>much</em> better already.</p>
<p>Note that the change to <code>and+</code> has been made, so the operations are <code>and+</code>, <code>or+</code>, <code>xor+</code>.</p>
<p>We should make a topic to discuss code samples at some point (probably premature, should let the rest of the site settle first).  I think one important aspect of the samples is that they shouldn't bring in any new elements up front that will trigger old-timers to fear there is <em>"change for the sake of change"</em>.  So if we can just avoid <strong>foreach</strong> and <strong>for-each</strong> in the front page examples, as well as <code>and+</code> and <code>or+</code>, and only focus on big/cool totally new things, that would probably be ideal.</p>
