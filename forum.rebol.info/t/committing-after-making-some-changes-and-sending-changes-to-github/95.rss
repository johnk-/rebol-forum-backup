    <title>Committing after making some changes, and sending changes to GitHub</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/committing-after-making-some-changes-and-sending-changes-to-github/95</link>
    <description>So, I have pulled down the latest source inside the directory where my repo is

    git pull

After making some changes that I&#39;ve tested by compiling I want to commit these.  I&#39;ll do a `git pull` to make sure that there are no conflicts. But sometimes, I see errors with files that I&#39;ve made changes to files that I don&#39;t want so I just delete them again, and repeat the pull

Now I have to stage and then commit them

    git commit -a -m &quot;my commit message&quot;

or

    git commit -am &quot;my commit message&quot;

This saves your changes to the local git database.  You now need to save your changes on the master database i.e. the GitHub repository.

    git push

You will be asked for your GitHub identity and password, and then it will commit the changes directly for you.</description>
