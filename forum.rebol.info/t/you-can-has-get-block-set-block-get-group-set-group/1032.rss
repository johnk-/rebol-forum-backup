    <description>[**Yep, they&#39;re implemented!!!**](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/commit/f25087c0bbfbcef7fc6f71cb53fe69b16527b1d7)  Go try them out!!!

---
Years ago, discussions circled around what was so special about WORD! and PATH! that they should be the only ones with LIT-XXX! forms.  It seemed this was a bit that could equally apply to anything, e.g. **`group: &#39;(1 + 2)`**.

It took a while, but eventually a [general and clever solution was discovered](https://forum.rebol.info/t/quoted-arrives-formerly-known-as-lit-bit/995/2).  There&#39;s no LIT-XXX!, just QUOTED! as a container for any type...with any level of quoting.  It&#39;s done with neat tricks!

## ...but what about SET-XXX and GET-XXX?

In that same vein, we might ask why PATH! and WORD! are the only types with SET-XXX! and GET-XXX! forms.  Aren&#39;t those just bits too?

GET-BLOCK! seems very useful if it would do a REDUCE in the evaluator.  Instead of **return reduce [x y]** you could just say **return :[x y]**.  SET-GROUP seems like it might be a little tidier too...

    word: &#39;x
    set word 1020

    word: &#39;x
    (word): 1020

It&#39;s only one less *character*.  But whether you have a preference for one or the other visually, the second can be done faster; the evaluator doesn&#39;t have to look up SET to find the function, nor go through the trouble of filling function frames and dispatching.  It&#39;s much lighter-weight.

## Yet it seems a slippery slope...

GET-BLOCK! and SET-GROUP! sure seem useful, but if we look at this as more cases of the &quot;lit bit&quot;, where does it stop?

If every type has a &quot;get bit&quot; and a &quot;set bit&quot;, can you have both of them?  How does this mix with the LIT-XXX forms?  Is there a difference between a LIT-SET-PATH! and a SET-LIT-PATH?

What would a SET-URL! look like?  How are the colons mixing up with literals that have colons in them?  *(:15 is a TIME! in the current world..., that would become a GET-INTEGER!, so what does a GET-TIME! look like?)*

This foiled ideas of the past, like trying to get rid of SET-PATH! and GET-PATH! and just say, e.g. &quot;a SET-PATH! is one with a SET-WORD! in its last slot&quot;.  Because then to get **x/1:** you would need SET-INTEGER!, to get **x/(y + z):** you&#39;d need SET-GROUP!, and it just seemed to go to chaos.

In the absence of a clear plan, we plodded along with the status quo, awaiting some moment of clarity.

## Moment of clarity arrived: Just add BLOCK! and GROUP!

If we only allow SET and GET forms on containers, it&#39;s a clean model (no worries about intersecting with lexical rules of the contained types).  And you get your dialected parts.  Need a SET-INTEGER! ?  Well, you [no can has](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sites/cheezburger).  But with containers, you get it all:

     my-dialect [
         [1]: &quot;It&#39;s just as good, as `1:`, really!&quot;

         :(:15) &quot;Even better, as if you want GET-FIFTEEN-MINUTES!, you can have it...&quot;

         [http://example.com/colons-legal-in-url:]: &quot;Yup, colons are legal in URL!s&quot;

         (your multi-value expression here): &quot;goes great with expressions!&quot;
     ]

*Then we stop.*  We get 4 new parts that are genuinely useful, that make the evaluator more expressive and run common functionality faster.  If you find uses in your dialects--and you almost certainly will--so much the better.

## The commit for them fixes flaws in the scanner

There were some things you couldn&#39;t make.  In Rebol2/R3-Alpha/Red:

    rebol2&gt;&gt; first [:a/(b + c)]                       
    == a/(b + c):

    rebol2&gt;&gt; first [:(a + b)/c]
    ** Syntax error: invalid &quot;word-get&quot; -- &quot;:&quot;

It might seem like it wouldn&#39;t be that hard to fix, but fixing it is a lot easier if you can just pass through a moment where the head of that block is a GET-GROUP! and then twiddle it into a regular GROUP! later.  (That&#39;s how GET-PATH! works when it has a GET-WORD!-looking thing at the head).  The scanner is already rather fiddly and throwing in more fiddly-bits is not forward-looking.

This lets that work basically for free, just a minor tweak on the previous method:

    &gt;&gt; first [:(a + b)/c]
    == :(a + b)/c

    &gt;&gt; type of p: first [:(a + b)/c]
    == get-path!

    type of first p
    == group!  ;-- regular GROUP! as first element of GET-PATH!, perfect
 
## They&#39;re awesome, you&#39;ll love &#39;em

Try them out and let me know what you think, and if you find cool new dialect applications!  Some demos:

    ; GET-BLOCK!, doing a fast REDUCE
    &gt;&gt; a: 10
    &gt;&gt; b: 20
    &gt;&gt; :[a b]
    == [10 20]

    ; GET-GROUP!, getting a PATH!
    &gt;&gt; o: make object! [f: 304]
    &gt;&gt; path: &#39;o/f
    &gt;&gt; :(path)
    == 304

    ; SET-GROUP!, setting a BLOCK!
    &gt;&gt; m: &lt;before&gt;
    &gt;&gt; o: make object! [f: &lt;before&gt;]
    &gt;&gt; block: [m o/f]
    &gt;&gt; (block): [1020 304]
    &gt;&gt; block
    == [m o/f]
    &gt;&gt; m
    == 1020
    &gt;&gt; o/f
    == 304

    ; SET-BLOCK!, with a block on the right
    &gt;&gt; a: _ b: _
    &gt;&gt; [a b]: [10 20]
    &gt;&gt; a
    == 10
    &gt;&gt; b
    == 20

    ; SET-BLOCK! with a non-block on the right
    &gt;&gt; a: _
    &gt;&gt; b: _
    &gt;&gt; [a b]: &lt;thing&gt;
    &gt;&gt; a
    == &lt;thing&gt;
    &gt;&gt; b
    == &lt;thing&gt;

I&#39;m sure people will think of improvements, but that&#39;s for starters.

And note they&#39;ll get even better with [mirror bytes](https://forum.rebol.info/t/mirrored-type-bytes-explained/1008), where **(x):** won&#39;t cost any more than **x:** !!!  I&#39;m relatively confident I can make that happen, some groundwork is done already.</description>

<p>Glad you like it <img src="//forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=7" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> but compared to generalized quoting and how it interacts with and preserves binding, this particular change is "trivial" (but let's see Oldes and Red do it, I'm waiting...)</p>
<p>I've tried to be as much of a bean counter as I can, to the extent of embracing-and-extending Carl's micro-optimization urges.  And while "micro-optimization" has a bit of a pejorative tone to it, we must remember that getting to the core of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_complexity" rel="nofollow noopener">essential complexity</a> of any system is something you could think of as "optimization", and getting to the core of it may be "micro-optimization".</p>
<p>If you look at how <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/245f25f61b51889039449432c6fa0285e21ee3bb/src/boot/types.r#L258" rel="nofollow noopener">the bytes in the type table are lining up</a>, you can see a lot of interesting relationships.  Numbers that aren't picked randomly.  If you subtract 2 from the ID for a BLOCK! you get a GET-BLOCK!, if you subtract 2 from the ID for a WORD! you get a GET-WORD!.  If you're wondering why it's subtraction and not addition with BLOCK! the lower value, it's because the value of BLOCK! has to be higher than that of GET-BLOCK! and SET-BLOCK! to push it across the comparison line for types that need evaluation, so there's a quick <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> test for "do you need evaluation".</p>
<p>Long story short: I've actually taken the "micro-optimization" tendencies of Carl and pushed it to all the way up to 3.</p>

<p>I was looking at the <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/f25087c0bbfbcef7fc6f71cb53fe69b16527b1d7/make/tools/systems.r#L53" rel="nofollow noopener">systems.r</a> table, and noticed this:</p>
<pre><code>Amiga: 1
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.1.01 _ "m68k20+"
    ; was: "Amiga V2.0-3.1 68020+"

0.1.02 _ "m68k"
    ; was: "Amiga V2.0-3.1 68000"
</code></pre>
<p>It tries to break things into sections, and considers the SET-WORD! alone to be too slight.  Of course, it could have said <code>[Amiga 1]</code>.  But it made me wonder, does a SET-BLOCK! look even better?</p>
<pre><code>[Amiga]: 1

0.1.01 _ "m68k20+"
    ; was: "Amiga V2.0-3.1 68020+"

0.1.02 _ "m68k"
    ; was: "Amiga V2.0-3.1 68000"
</code></pre>
<p>It might look a bit more divider-y that way, with low-cost and light weight.</p>
<p>With blanks in paths not showing, you get some other interesting concepts:</p>
<pre><code>//Amiga// 1

0.1.01 _ "m68k20+"
    ; was: "Amiga V2.0-3.1 68020+"

0.1.02 _ "m68k"
    ; was: "Amiga V2.0-3.1 68000"
</code></pre>
<p>Pretty weird, but one of those things about seeing outside "The Matrix" of programming...to where you get to paint/mold/sculpt with code in ways Lisps won't let you...yet have it be machine processable in the same vein....</p>

            <p>I am curious what in general the idea is for handling get-things at the head of a path, and set-things at the tail. Before this it was just words, but now it can be []s or ()s. In particular, wasn't it just decided that having a get-word at the tail of a set-path (as in <code>a/:b: 3</code>) is to be deprecated in favour of ()-ing it (as in <code>a/(b): 3</code>)?</p>
<p>This change makes it even more important to clearly specify the rules for what can go into a path and where:<br>
is <code>:[a]/[b]:</code> a get-path with a set-block at its tail, or a set-path with a get-block at its head?</p>

<p><em>Then we stop.</em>  We get 4 new parts that are genuinely useful, that make the evaluator more expressive and run common functionality faster.  If you find uses in your dialects--and you almost certainly will--so much the better.</p>
<h2>The commit for them fixes flaws in the scanner</h2>
<p>There were some things you couldn't make.  In Rebol2/R3-Alpha/Red:</p>
<pre><code>rebol2&gt;&gt; first [:a/(b + c)]                       
== a/(b + c):

rebol2&gt;&gt; first [:(a + b)/c]
** Syntax error: invalid "word-get" -- ":"
</code></pre>
<p>It might seem like it wouldn't be that hard to fix, but fixing it is a lot easier if you can just pass through a moment where the head of that block is a GET-GROUP! and then twiddle it into a regular GROUP! later.  (That's how GET-PATH! works when it has a GET-WORD!-looking thing at the head).  The scanner is already rather fiddly and throwing in more fiddly-bits is not forward-looking.</p>
<p>This lets that work basically for free, just a minor tweak on the previous method:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; first [:(a + b)/c]
== :(a + b)/c

&gt;&gt; type of p: first [:(a + b)/c]
== get-path!

type of first p
== group!  ;-- regular GROUP! as first element of GET-PATH!, perfect
</code></pre>
<h2>They're awesome, you'll love 'em</h2>
<p>Try them out and let me know what you think, and if you find cool new dialect applications!  Some demos:</p>
<pre><code>; GET-BLOCK!, doing a fast REDUCE
&gt;&gt; a: 10
&gt;&gt; b: 20
&gt;&gt; :[a b]
== [10 20]

; GET-GROUP!, getting a PATH!
&gt;&gt; o: make object! [f: 304]
&gt;&gt; path: 'o/f
&gt;&gt; :(path)
== 304

; SET-GROUP!, setting a BLOCK!
&gt;&gt; m: &lt;before&gt;
&gt;&gt; o: make object! [f: &lt;before&gt;]
&gt;&gt; block: [m o/f]
&gt;&gt; (block): [1020 304]
&gt;&gt; block
== [m o/f]
&gt;&gt; m
== 1020
&gt;&gt; o/f
== 304

; SET-BLOCK!, with a block on the right
&gt;&gt; a: _ b: _
&gt;&gt; [a b]: [10 20]
&gt;&gt; a
== 10
&gt;&gt; b
== 20

; SET-BLOCK! with a non-block on the right
&gt;&gt; a: _
&gt;&gt; b: _
&gt;&gt; [a b]: &lt;thing&gt;
&gt;&gt; a
== &lt;thing&gt;
&gt;&gt; b
== &lt;thing&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I'm sure people will think of improvements, but that's for starters.</p>
<p>And note they'll get even better with <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/mirrored-type-bytes-explained/1008">mirror bytes</a>, where <strong>(x):</strong> won't cost any more than <strong>x:</strong> !!!  I'm relatively confident I can make that happen, some groundwork is done already.</p>
