    <title>Library of definitions</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/library-of-definitions/1624</link>
    <description>When exploring the sources I regularly encounter macro&#39;s, structures and functions that have been defined earlier.

But what is the definition and in which source file has it been declared? 

So searching using searchmonkey or grep and getting loads of hits is cumbersome.

Therefore I think a library of definitions can be a very helpful instrument documenting this information and give quick resolution to above issues.

Suggestions for a good place to keep this around?</description>
