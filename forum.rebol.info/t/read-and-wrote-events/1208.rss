    <title>READ and WROTE events</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/read-and-wrote-events/1208</link>
    <description>There is something called an AWAIT handler, which is essentially a callback on a PORT! to tell you about events that have happened.

I don&#39;t want to get too deep into the R3-Alpha port model, but something has always bugged me about the naming of the events you get back when a particular asynchronous READ or WRITE has happened.  That&#39;s because the events are named READ and WROTE.

With WRITE and WROTE there is fortunately a spelling difference for the present and past tenses.  But unfortunately READ (&quot;reed&quot;) and READ (&quot;red&quot;) are spelled the same for present and past.

Right now, having a tense change is not strictly necessary...as you don&#39;t get a READ-BEGIN and WRITE-BEGIN event.  The only events you hear about with reading and writing are after-the-fact.  (It&#39;s the port &quot;actor&quot; that receives the initiating requests as READ and WRITE).

**So calling the events READ and WRITE would seemingly be fine, and the author of the await handler can just accept that it&#39;s after.**  Saying &quot;wrote&quot; *seems* cute but the inconsistent appearance makes one wonder if there&#39;s a twisted variant of READ that you should be looking for as well.  I think it causes more problems than it solves, because in software we are always pronouncing READ as &quot;reed&quot; in our heads.</description>

            <p>That seems pretty good for networking, at least!  I guess the question is the more general issue of whether "transmission" terminology feels right when you're talking about I/O to other devices--for instance, a terminal.</p>
<p>Worth considering...</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/mark-hi">@Mark-hi</a> / <a class="mention" href="/u/markeye">@MarkEye</a> suggested the pairings <strong>read/gotten</strong> and <strong>write/written</strong>.</p>
<p>I have mixed feelings here.  One part of me thinks that going down this kind of creative path is part of what makes the whole project tick - to try and do deep thought and be clever with language.  Another part wonders if this is just being weird for weirdness sake.</p>

            <p>Annoyingly, I believe WRITE and WROTE are different event types.</p>
<p>There is the ON-* convention, though that's usually used by handler names:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">switch event/type [
    on-read [
        do something
    ]
    on-write [
        do something else
    ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>Keeping somewhat compatible with <a href="http://www.rebol.com/r3/docs/view/events.html#section-13" rel="nofollow noopener">GUI event names</a> would be good as a rule even if a GUI is not on the horizon.</p>
<p>Some other thoughts would be:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-nohighlight">did-read did-write did-click did-lookup did-open did-resize

; Shakespearian
read'd write'd click'd
read-d write-d click-d
read-ed write-ed click-ed

; something about to happen
will-read will-write will-click (currently 'down)
</code></pre>
