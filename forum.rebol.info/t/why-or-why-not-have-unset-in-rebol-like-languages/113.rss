    <title>Why (or why not) have UNSET! in Rebol-like Languages</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/why-or-why-not-have-unset-in-rebol-like-languages/113</link>
    <description>*(**UPDATE**: I&#39;ve edited this post to reflect the terminology change to NULL.  But also, I found a post on Carl&#39;s blog titled [&quot;UNSET! is not first-class&quot;](http://www.rebol.net/r3blogs/0318.html).  It doesn&#39;t particularly add anything new, but shows signs of a desire to differentiate the state...which seems to naturally culminate in Ren-C&#39;s choice to make it impossible to store it in BLOCK!s.)*

Question asked of me was:

&gt; Could you explain in laymen terms why unset! is there in Rebol type languages, and why it&#39;s there?
To my brain, something like none makes more sense to use for &#39;no thing&#39;. I get that unset removes the reference between word and value(s), but unset pops up for &quot;no return value&quot;, even though it&#39;s a return value, and &#39;none&#39;-ish things.

UNSET!&#39;s existence is ostensibly from wanting to give a distinction between a variable that is not set (should cause an error if accessed) vs. set.  Rebol would be a more unsafe language if such a state were not available.  You&#39;d just go typing `if my-varable = 1 [...]` when you meant to say my-variable and there&#39;d be no indication of a problem.

Note that the reason you don&#39;t get a &quot;no binding&quot; error for a misspelling comes from the somewhat liberal choice to bind words dynamically in the user context just because they appear.  It&#39;s the reason you can write:

    &gt;&gt; print-foo: does [print foo] ;-- gets bound here
    &gt;&gt; print-foo
    ** error (it&#39;s in bound state but not set)
    &gt;&gt; foo: 10
    &gt;&gt; print-foo
    10

The `foo` in `print foo` gets a binding to the user context, even though there was no `foo` defined there beforehand.  If that weren&#39;t the case and it expanded on seeing set-words only, there&#39;d be more
safety against typos...which might make it somewhat less critical to have a &quot;defined-but-not-set&quot; state.

Yet I&#39;d still argue that typos aside, it&#39;s valuable to have knowledge of when you&#39;ve used something before you&#39;ve explicitly assigned it.  So this &quot;bound yet triggers an error in casual usage&quot; state is generally useful.

But I agree with you on the next point... that conveying this state of a variable as a &quot;value&quot; which has a &quot;type&quot;, and can be inserted into a block, is a bad idea.

One could imagine it not being conveyable at all except through an `is-variable-set?` test for those concerned with the status...and other forms of access would be errors.  But one could also designate it a special transitional status that simply can&#39;t be put in blocks.... *which is what Ren-C does.*

So NULL is not a &quot;value&quot;.  It&#39;s in fact, the absence of a value. &quot;set?&quot; or &quot;unset?&quot; are questions asked of *variables*, e.g. `SET? &#39;X` or `UNSET? &#39;X/Y`.  Then `VALUE?` is a question you can ask of an evaluation product, e.g. `VALUE? :NOT-SET-THING` is false.  But the system protects against any instances of a &quot;null cell&quot; making it into the body of a block or other array.  `TYPE OF :NOT-SET-THING` will also come back as a NULL.

Now once you have this non-valued thing, it would be a bit of a shame to waste its unique status.  Ren-C uses it as the outcome of a failed conditional, while forcing all successful conditionals to some value (&quot;voidifying&quot; it if the branch evaluates to NULL).  So...

    &gt;&gt; block: copy [a b c]
    &gt;&gt; append block if false [&#39;d]
    == [a b c]
    &gt;&gt; append block if true [&#39;d]
    == [a b c d]
    &gt;&gt; append block if true []
    == [a b c d #[void]]

Since you never meant to intentionally append a null to a block (as that is impossible) you have this extra dimension of flexibility.

There is also &quot;refinement revocation&quot;, where nulls un-ask for the refinement:

    &gt;&gt; block: copy [a b c]
    &gt;&gt; append/dup block &#39;foo if false [3]
    [a b c]
    &gt;&gt; append/dup block &#39;foo if true [3]
    [a b c foo foo foo]

The out-of-band nature is taken advantage of in &quot;expert&quot; operators, which differentiate between no value and a legitimate blank value:

    &gt;&gt; block: copy [a _]
    &gt;&gt; take* block
    == a
    &gt;&gt; take* block
    == _
    &gt;&gt; take* block
    // null

A casual `TAKE` operation built on top of `TAKE*` will give you an error if it didn&#39;t actually take anything, as opposed to returning NULL.  Similar solutions help one put blank values in maps, and distinguish that from the absence of a value.

To summarize: the &quot;null&quot; state which is helpful in denoting a transient situation of &quot;complete absence of value&quot; becomes much more useful when you can confidently say it&#39;s *not* a value, and is never stored in blocks or other data structures.  Then it can really indicate some out-of-band quality.  Blanks (&quot;nones&quot;) are too casually used as actual placeholders to serve these purposes.</description>

            <p>I don't know what you have to gain by embracing this fallacy.</p>
<p><em>Variables</em> are "set" or "unset".  Not <strong>values</strong>.  All <em>values</em> should represent a "set" state.</p>
<pre><code>x: 10
if set? 'x [print "The variable is set."]

set 'x 20
if set? 'x [print "Yup, the variable is still set."]

unset 'x
comment [x: null]  ; alternative unset method

if unset? 'x [print "Now it's unset."]
if null? :x [print "Here's another way to do it."]
if not value? :x [print "A way of saying the same thing."]
</code></pre>
<p>Generic code has to process blocks of values, and it's just not helping anyone when you can put "unset values" in blocks.  Imagine enumerating this block, each item stored in a variable as you go.  The variable you are using to enumerate the block runs into a problem... it has to hold the current item, yet it also might be unset.  Don't you see why this is not right?</p>
<p>I'll point out that Ren-C's ANY-VALUE! is not only more clear than ANY-TYPE! (which has a bad property of seeming like ANY-DATATYPE!, e.g. DATATYPE!) but it also does <em>not</em> include NULL.  Optional parameters are "denoted" differently, but ANY-VALUE! means specifically anything that isn't NULL.  Hence ANY-VALUE? and VALUE? are synonyms.</p>

<p>@dockimbel: @gltewalt Redbol languages are based on denotational semantics, where the meaning of every expression needs to have a representation in the language itself. Every expression needs to return a value. Without `unset!` there would be a hole...</p>

<p>Redbol languages are based on denotational semantics, where the meaning of every expression needs to have a representation in the language itself. Every expression needs to return a value. Without unset! there would be a hole in the language, several fundamental semantic rules would be collapsing, e.g. reduce [1 print ""] =&gt; [1] (reducing 2 expressions would return 1 expression).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I suppose he hasn't read Godel, Escher, Bach.</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that there is no such thing as a "complete" system.  All we do is push complexity around in order to shape the territory to become suitable for our purposes.</p>
<p>Somehow, the idea that <strong>reduce [1 print ""]</strong> could be an <em>error</em> is by its definition <em>worse</em> than having a block that holds a "unset value".</p>
<p>It's strange how uneducated minds work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Ren-C has a #[void] datatype which is used to represent an "ornery" value, and in the evaluator it acts very much like #[unset] did.  And it's actually what PRINT returns, so this REDUCE works (albeit leaving such an ornery value there).  <em>But void very notably has nothing to do with "unsetness"</em> ... <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/why-void-is-not-like-unset-and-why-its-more-ornery/947">see explanation</a>.  And many other operations <em>will</em> error, e.g. <strong>reduce [1 find [a b c] 'd]</strong>... you have to write <strong>reduce [1 try find [a b c] 'd]</strong></p>
