    <title>Parameter Order in Rebol</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/parameter-order-in-rebol/1238</link>
    <description>With the advent of [Point-Free expression](https://forum.rebol.info/t/looking-into-a-usermode-pointfree/1236), things that were wordy using SPECIALIZE are now succinct.  You don&#39;t have to name the parameters...which saves typing and also keeps you from having to look it up:

    next: specialize &#39;skip [offset: 1]
    ;
    ; ...becomes
    ;
    next: (&lt;- skip _ 1)

Though that placeholder is a little bit unsatisfying.  Which means one starts looking at questions like &quot;in Rebol, why isn&#39;t the offset to skip by *first*&quot;.  In the narrow case of this specialization, it would make it a bit briefer and seem more natural...

    next: (&lt;- skip 1)

And to play devil&#39;s advocate, if Rebol is to be English-inspired instead of traditional OOP inspired...wouldn&#39;t you say:

    &quot;Skip 10 pages ahead&quot;

Instead of the more awkward:

    &quot;Skip pages ahead by 10&quot;

It&#39;s almost like the underscore in the partial specialization is playing the role of `&quot;by&quot;`.  But, anyway--is there some kind of universal rule to guide such decisions?

## Most-or-Least Important Thing First

Since this looks very Haskell-y, here&#39;s a good summary paragraph [from a StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31738041/211160) on why Haskell users would favor `(&lt;- skip 1)` to `(&lt;- skip _ 1)`:

&gt; *&quot;It&#39;s common practice in Haskell to order function parameters so that parameters which &quot;configure&quot; an operation come first, and the &quot;main thing being operated on&quot; comes last. This is often counter intuitive coming from other languages, since it tends to mean you end up passing the &quot;least important&quot; information first. It&#39;s especially jarring coming from OO where the &quot;main&quot; argument is usually the object on which the method is being invoked, occurring so early in in the call that it&#39;s out of the parameter list entirely!&quot;*

One thing about the least important parameter is it is often briefer to express.  Consider the example we hit with DELIMIT when the data to act on was first:

    delimit [
        &quot;here&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;my&quot;
        long block of code stuff
        &quot;and we go on for a while&quot;
    ] &quot;,&quot;

By the time you get to the comma, you might have forgotten what you are doing.  It seems it&#39;s pretty rare for the thing you&#39;re delimiting with to be coming from a long and complex expression, while the thing you&#39;re operating on may well be a giant expression (like a COLLECT).

So @johnk and I thought it seemed better to say:

    delimit &quot;,&quot; [
        &quot;here&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;my&quot;
        long block of code stuff
        &quot;and we go on for a while&quot;
    ]

So that was changed...and as a consequence we get natural-looking specializations now like:
 
    spaced: (&lt;- delimit space)

What does this mean for old-school institutions like SKIP?  I don&#39;t know.  **But I do know it&#39;s getting faster and clearer to bend the system to anything you want it to be...**</description>

            <p><strong>RE: Parameter Order in Rebol</strong></p>
<p>To pick this thread back up and expand it further... this issue is now emerging in <em>return</em> parameter ordering, with multi-returns.  <em>(Not that you wouldn't have had the issue of deciding parameter order before if you were doing multi-returns by way of a block...)</em></p>
<p>I've mentioned that I think <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/the-need-to-rethink-error/1371">error handling needs a reboot</a>, and figuring out where <strong>error:</strong> belongs in the return order may be a thing.  I also mentioned how we might somehow break that distinguished case out, like...</p>
<pre><code>; function that returns 3 values and a possible error
;
[a b c].err: some-func arg1 arg2 arg3
</code></pre>
<p>We might even look at there being a difference between ordered returns and unordered ones:</p>
<pre><code>foo: func [
    return: "main return"
    r2: "ordered return slot 2"
    r3: "ordered return slot 4"
    /foo: "unordered return"
    /bar: "another unordered return"
][
    ...
]
</code></pre>
<p>But even if a return has an ordered position, that doesn't have to mean that the caller has to ask for it.  This would be a difference from ordered parameters being required.</p>

            <p>I think it has been mentioned somewhere before:</p>
<p>If refinements are their own parameters, couldn't parameters also be their own refinements?</p>
<p>This would mean, you could change the order of parameters at the callsite.</p>
<p>It feels a little weird, that you would have to add a parameter as refinement to the call, to move it to the end.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; f: func [a b][print spaced [a b]]

‌&gt;&gt; f 1 2
1 2

‌&gt;&gt; f/a 1 2
2 1</code></pre>
