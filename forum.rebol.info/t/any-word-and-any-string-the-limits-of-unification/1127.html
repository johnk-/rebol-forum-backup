          <p>There's been a very longstanding question of just how much ANY-WORD!s and ANY-STRING!s should share in common--and how aware users should be of the differences.</p>
<h2>1. What about spaces, or starting with digits, etc.?</h2>
<p>One question is whether ANY-WORD! should differ because there were illegal characters, like space:</p>
<pre><code>rebol2&gt;&gt; to word! "word with spaces"
== word with spaces  ; Rebol2 allowed it

r3-alpha&gt;&gt; to word! "word with spaces"
** Script error: contains invalid characters  ; R3-Alpha disallowed it

red&gt;&gt; to word! "word with spaces"
== word  ; Red has its own...idea
</code></pre>
<p>While spaces in words should be discouraged, so should they in filenames.  But this doesn't <em>necessarily</em> mean they should be illegal.</p>
<p>The problem with making them illegal is it would mean dialect authors would have to create their own escaping mechanisms.  If every dialect author had to come up with a notation for putting spaces in words, they might do it a different way.  Standardizing it would avoid that problem, and then you'd just have a notation <em>(we've discussed a seemingly worst-case <code>#[set-word! "set word with spaces"]</code>)</em></p>
<p><strong>But Ren-C has enough parts to live with "no ANY-WORD! escaping"</strong></p>
<pre><code>Fork: "It's nice to use SET-WORD!s for character names in a screenplay."

3-Headed-Clown: &lt;annoyed&gt; "But there's only one dash in my name, not two!"

Fork: "We have a lot more tools for tackling this now..."
[Hostile Fork]: "...SET-BLOCK! with WORD!s covers spaces for instance."

["3-Headed Clown"]: "I see--but I'd need a TEXT!"
["3-Headed" Clown]: "Or, at least I'd need *one* for invalid WORD!s"
[3 Headed Clown]: "I could also change my name use INTEGER!.  Hahaha...not!"

(Hostile Fork): "Another option here is SET-GROUP!s"
@(Hostile Fork) "SYM-GROUP!s are a planned feature for the near future."
@[Hostile Fork] "SYM-BLOCK!s should be available too."

"3-Headed Clown"/: "Or PATH!s too!  It's all up to the dialect author."
//"3-Headed Clown"//: "That's pretty awesome."

Fork: "Sure, but know that not all types are legal in PATH! (e.g. URL!)"
</code></pre>
<p>If you think about it, this is <em>kind of</em> a "standardized form of escaping".  The only pain point would be--for instance--if you have another clever idea for what SET-BLOCK!s should do in your dialect.  You might feel it was wasted being the "container for TEXT! that represents what a SET-WORD! would have been it could have held spaces".</p>
<p>I think this falls into the realm of acceptable cost.  Guaranteeing ANY-WORD! doesn't have spaces may be a limitation of a "freedom to", but it gives you a "freedom from" that has some value.</p>
<h2>2. What about binding?</h2>
<p>R3-Alpha made ISSUE! an ANY-WORD.  This was <a href="http://www.rebol.net/cgi-bin/r3blog.r?view=0108#comments" rel="nofollow noopener">a controversial idea</a>, and giving ISSUE!s bindings wasn't really thought through:</p>
<pre><code>r3-alpha&gt;&gt; set #123 456
== 456

r3-alpha&gt;&gt; words-of bind? #123
== [system set 123 words-of bind?]
</code></pre>
<p>You just created a context key called 123, despite that being an illegal word:</p>
<pre><code>r3-alpha&gt;&gt; to word! "123"
** Syntax error: invalid character in: "123"
</code></pre>
<p>So ISSUE! became the poster child for "weird things getting bound".  But now, I think this just represents a mistake.  It opened a can of worms, and we should re-seal the can.</p>
<p>Getting an inert word type in the form of <span class="mention">@SYM-WORD</span> is going to make up for it.</p>
<h2>Executive Summary</h2>
<p><em><a href="../realistically-migrating-rebol-to-utf8-everywhere/374/4.html">UTF-8 Everywhere</a> has arrived!</em>  The best information we're going to get for Beta/One is probably in front of us now.</p>
<p>I think I see the architectural lines drawn up pretty well for what has to happen.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You <strong>can't</strong> have a binding on an ANY-STRING!, and you <strong>can't</strong> index into an ANY-WORD! directly.  Hence all ANY-WORD! are at their head position--as they have always been.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All valid content for an ANY-WORD! is legal for an ANY-STRING!.  Hence you <strong>can</strong> alias an ANY-WORD! as an ANY-STRING! <em>without creating a new series</em>.  <strong>as text! (first [foo])</strong> would not allocate any additional memory--the string would merely honor the "locked" status bit of the underlying <code>foo</code> node.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not all content for ANY-STRING! is legal in ANY-WORD!.  For example, spaces--or starting with a number.  This may imply disallowing <strong>as word! "foo"</strong> as collateral damage for the illegality of <strong>as word! "foo bar"</strong>.  Or there may be tricks to allow some conversions sometimes, but we don't really need to worry about.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ISSUE! is going back to being an ANY-STRING!, where <strong><span class="hashtag">#123</span></strong> is legal without raising any questions about what is legal in an ANY-WORD!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>REFINEMENT! is gone, so <strong>/foo</strong> is a PATH! with a WORD! in it, and <strong>/1</strong> is a PATH! with an INTEGER! in it.  So it doesn't factor into the WORD! question any more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SYMBOL-WORD! <a href="../at-word-at-path-at-group-and-at-block/1125/5.html">(working title)</a> will bring a category of inert word to take ISSUE!'s place, where <strong><span class="mention">@123</span></strong> will be illegal.  It will be part of a family of inerts, along with <strong>@(...)</strong>, <strong>@.../.../...</strong>, and <strong>@[...]</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
