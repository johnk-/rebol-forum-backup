    <title>Sea of Words is now in Beta (or something?)... Some Numbers</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/sea-of-words-is-now-in-beta-or-something-some-numbers/1678</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve gotten Sea of Words through the test suite and Bootstrap...and running the scenarios that have GitHub Actions (rebol-httpd, rebol-odbc, rebol-whitespacers.)  And I got it working in the web console too, of course!

*(Note: If the web console seems sluggish these days don&#39;t blame Sea of Words...I started using UPARSE in it, and right now UPARSE is in full-on experimental mode.  It&#39;s a beast, so using it at all--even on trivial samples--will be resource intensive.)*

# Some Easy-To-Get Numbers For The Moment

**These numbers should be taken with a grain of salt...** they don&#39;t measure everything, and some things shift around in ways that are hard to quantify.  But they&#39;re better than nothing.

(Note: I actually had to fix a bug in the evaluation count that was giving wild answers.  R3-Alpha lacked a double-check on its optimized method of incrementing the total evaluation count without needing to so every time in the loop...)

## Prior to Sea of Words

Here is a report from a freshly booted desktop build on Windows, which avoids trying to read the executable into memory:

    &gt;&gt; stats/profile
    == make object! [
        evals: 123702
        series-made: 53630
        series-freed: 27122
        series-expanded: 728
        series-bytes: 3460161
        series-recycled: 25447
        made-blocks: 33403
        made-objects: 191
        recycles: 3
    ]

## After Sea of Words

    &gt;&gt; stats/profile
    == make object! [
        evals: 138386
        series-made: 72860
        series-freed: 39697
        series-expanded: 706
        series-bytes: 3270669
        series-recycled: 20856
        made-blocks: 52054
        made-objects: 221
        recycles: 3
    ]

On the bright side, **Sea of Words is not only a watershed moment in binding/modules, it&#39;s also saving 189K or so of memory**, even just here in its first debut.

You may be wondering why there are so many more blocks.  The answer is that they&#39;re very *tiny* optimized stub blocks, used to hold individual variables that are floating in the &quot;sea&quot;.  This is expected and purposeful.  As shown, the total memory use went down... 

## This is Really Only A Beginning

While the abilities that just came into play are a tremendous step for making a &quot;real&quot; and usable module system, there is significantly more left.  I&#39;ll be posting more on those issues after some :zzz:</description>
