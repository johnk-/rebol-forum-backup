    <title>SmartGit Free For Personal Use</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/smartgit-free-for-personal-use/1769</link>
    <description>This isn&#39;t really advertised all that loudly.  But SmartGit is free for personal use now:

  https://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/

I&#39;ve only been using it a little bit so far, but from the bit I&#39;ve seen it seems to be a lot more functional than SourceTree.

I imagine that things like VSCode having pretty passable in-built version control and extensions is probably putting some pressure on these kinds of products.</description>
