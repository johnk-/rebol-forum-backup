    <title>TAG!s as PARSE keywords vs. Literal Matches</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/tag-s-as-parse-keywords-vs-literal-matches/1558</link>
    <description>Previously I brought up the idea of &quot;TAG! combinators&quot;.  Here&#39;s what I said, moved from another thread where it was kind of a tangent:

&gt; [I saw Haskell...] uses EOF instead of END.  END is literate, but one often wants to call variables things like &quot;begin&quot; or &quot;end&quot;, or &quot;start&quot; and &quot;end&quot;.
&gt;
&gt; This makes me wonder if perhaps we should be a bit more creative in the use of datatypes.  If you want to match a WORD! in a dialect, you have to use a tick mark.  What if you had to use a tick mark to match TAG!s, and then an ordinary TAG! could have meaning as a rule...such as **`&lt;end&gt;`**?
&gt;
&gt;     parse &quot;aaa&quot; [data: copy to &lt;end&gt;]
&gt;
&gt;     parse &quot;&lt;div&gt;stuff&lt;/div&gt;&quot; [x: between &#39;&lt;div&gt; &#39;&lt;/div&gt;]
&gt;
&gt; Anyway, that could open up a whole new category of combinators... tag combinators.  Maybe **`&lt;here&gt;`** is another example, or perhaps **`&lt;input&gt;`** if you want to pass the original input position through to a function.
&gt;
&gt; A unifying concept here could be that you&#39;d use it for properties that you don&#39;t want to have collide with the names of variables.  Consider for example if PARSE tracks the line number, you might want to say something like **`line: &lt;line&gt;`** in the middle of a rule.
&gt;
&gt; If you want to match tags by their stringness, it&#39;s not like it&#39;s all that hard to just say **`&quot;&lt;div&gt;&quot;`** in the first place.  But quoting is even briefer.  Remember that being inert in typical evaluation is not enough in PARSE to mean it&#39;s not a rule... INTEGER!, BLOCK!, BLANK! (previously NONE!) and now LOGIC! all have to be quoted to mean their actual literal thing.  And quotes are needed on things like WORD!, GROUP!, GET-WORD!, SET-WORD!...and much more. 
&gt;
&gt; So is it worth it to get another dialect part, by making you have to quote your tags if you want them to match literally?  I kind of feel like it would be.  Of course, the concept with UPARSE is that people could disagree and make entirely different answers...
&gt;
&gt; *(Note: a downside here is that since TAG!s are strings and not symbols, the comparison costs could be (slightly) higher.  However, I&#39;ve been thinking that to speed up string comparisons they might cache a symbol as part of the comparison process...and clear the symbol cache on each mutation.  Then comparisons of strings to symbols could become very fast...so long as the string isn&#39;t changing.  Wouldn&#39;t help if it were looked up in a map, but the optimized native version could do a fast check before hitting the map.)*

## I&#39;ve decided this is too good an idea to pass on.

I particularly like that it makes a new namespace for nouns.  It&#39;s mean to take away words like &quot;end&quot; from &quot;start/end&quot; or &quot;begin/end&quot; that people might want to use for variables.

**So TAG! will not match string content in PARSE/UPARSE**.  If you want to literally match a tag in a block, use QUOTED! (as you would for other types):

    &gt;&gt; uparse [&lt;a&gt; &lt;a&gt; &lt;a&gt;] [some &#39;&lt;a&gt;]
    == &lt;a&gt;  ; remember, rules like SOME don&#39;t synthesize anything

    &gt;&gt; uparse [&lt;a&gt; &lt;a&gt; &lt;a&gt;] [copy some &#39;&lt;a&gt;]
    == [&lt;a&gt; &lt;a&gt; &lt;a&gt;]
 
There&#39;s no particular reason not to have it work in strings too for finding the molded form.  But in a string, you can use it in quotes.

    &gt;&gt; uparse &quot;&lt;a&gt;stuff&lt;/a&gt;&quot; [between &quot;&lt;a&gt;&quot; &quot;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;]
    == &quot;stuff&quot;

*Isn&#39;t that block-result-is-the-result-of-UPARSE convention awesome?*

## Remember that Combinators are Customizable

If you don&#39;t like this idea, you can change it...but I think the TAG!-as-parsing-NOUN concept is something we&#39;ll get mileage from.

I mention **`&lt;line&gt;`** and **`&lt;file&gt;`**.  It&#39;s nice to have these kinds of things not competing.

And I think it likely is going to look better for the likes of **`&lt;end&gt;`**.  I&#39;m sympathetic that **`to &lt;end&gt;`** is a bit more typing than **to end** but it seems pretty good.

## Maybe a good name for SKIP (matching any token) is **`&lt;any&gt;`** ?

    &gt;&gt; uparse? [xxx &quot;what about this?&quot; yyy] [&#39;xxx, item: &lt;any&gt;, &#39;yyy]
    == #[true]

    &gt;&gt; item
    == &quot;what about this?&quot;

It&#39;s a little bit more typing, but I&#39;ve been pretty displeased with the weakness of symbols like **`?`** and **`*`**.

And now that the ANY =&gt; WHILE transition is done we can kind of go back to reclaiming ANY for its natural sense.

**Power users will be able to override all of this.**

    uparse: specialize :uparse [
        ;
        ; Ugly way of extending a MAP!, there should be nicer ways.
        ;
        combinators: append copy default-combinators reduce [
            &#39;end :default-combinators/&lt;end&gt;
            &#39;* :default-combinators/&lt;any&gt;
        ]
    ]

    &gt;&gt; uparse [&#39;x &quot;y&quot; #z . . .] [word!, demo: *, issue!, to end]
    &gt;&gt; demo
    == &quot;y&quot;

But let&#39;s try starting to use it.  [**Here are the changes to the tests to get an idea of how this looks.**](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/commit/cb33e2b4d66d22a71c3d735580717801087d849e#diff-f5e0f7cccc2957408dafb743a9ce12ae24df6fd55494d0391e692090514f93acL8).  I&#39;ve left the old END and HERE and SKIP in for now, but I think we should move in this direction.

I also think getting `&lt;line&gt;` and `&lt;column&gt;` are pretty important, so that should get worked on...</description>

</aside>
<p>In <a class="mention" href="/u/rgchris">@rgchris</a>'s JSON parser, he actually uses HERE as the name of a marked location.</p>
<p>With TAG! combinators, you can do that.</p>
<pre><code>here: &lt;here&gt; (...code that uses here...)
</code></pre>
<p>But I actually hadn't retrofitted R3-Alpha parse to support the tags, just using the keyword HERE.  This reaffirms my belief that tag combinators are the right way to handle these nounish things.</p>
<p>I am doing the retrofit now...which will also turn END to <code>&lt;end&gt;</code>...but I'm defining a PARSE2 mode of the old native parse to make it easier to do bootstrapping.  There will be a UPARSE2 as well, so people can tinker with the combinators to their liking (if that's the old way, then fine).</p>

            <h2>This Has Turned Out To Be Gold</h2>
<p>Across the board it is good.  <code>&lt;any&gt;</code> has replaced SKIP, and <strong><code>item: &lt;any&gt;</code></strong> makes much more sense than <strong><code>item: skip</code></strong>.  <em>(If you're skipping it, why would you be assigning it?)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: There were some detours with other considerations.  <code>&lt;?&gt;</code> seemed to work better than a lot of things:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; uparse [1 2] [x: &lt;?&gt;, y: &lt;?&gt;]
&gt;&gt; x 
== 1
</code></pre>
<p>RegEx-style dot was also considered.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; uparse [1 2] [x: &lt;.&gt;, y: &lt;.&gt;]
&gt;&gt; x 
== 1
</code></pre>
<p>But <code>&lt;any&gt;</code> won out for its literacy.  You can still override it, and make your own combinator aliases... like Topaz uses <strong><code>*</code></strong> for it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Quoting TAG!s To Match Literally Is No Hassle</h2>
<p>There would still be the option of matching TAG!s with quoted tags, as with other quoted types.</p>
<pre><code>uparse [&lt;a&gt; &lt;a&gt;] [some '&lt;a&gt;]
</code></pre>
<p>You already have to do this with WORD!s, INTEGER!s, etc.  So the minor inconvenience of quoting another type is nothing compared to the value of opening up a new space for parsing keywords.</p>
<p>I think strings being the exception is good, it provides coverage for pretty much other types...when all you are doing with it is stringification anyway:</p>
<pre><code>uparse "&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;" [{&lt;a&gt;} {&lt;/a&gt;}]
</code></pre>
<h2>The Lazy Crowd Will Still Have Options...</h2>

<p>I confess I’m lazy and don’t like that I need to click SHiFT + for the angle brackets.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I have removed the non-TAG! variations from the default.</p>
<p>But it is currently looking like all you need to say is:</p>
<pre><code>end: &lt;end&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And it will work in your file.  Right now any plain WORD! that isn't a combinator is looked up as a rule, and if that rule takes no arguments it will work.</p>
<p>That rules out INTEGER! (since the INTEGER! combinator takes a rule as an argument to repeat).  So you have to say:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; num: 3

&gt;&gt; uparse "aaa" [repeat (num) "a"]
== "a"
</code></pre>
<p>...as opposed to just <strong>[num "a"]</strong>.  But for the moment, only rules which take arguments are forbidden to be looked up via WORD!.</p>
<p>In any case: I think that opening up TAG! as a whole category of subdispatched combinator is a winning idea, which will serve in the long run.</p>
