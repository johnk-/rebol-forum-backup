    <title>Indexes And Binding Positions</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/indexes-and-binding-positions/1519</link>
    <description>The fact that blocks have a &quot;somewhat hidden&quot; index in them creates no shortage of problems system-wide.  The semantics of this index are quite nebulous.  COPY doesn&#39;t see backwards, for instance:

    r3-alpha&gt;&gt; data: [a b c]

    r3-alpha&gt;&gt; pos: next data
    == [b c]

    r3-alpha&gt;&gt; copied-pos: copy pos
    == [b c]

    r3-alpha&gt;&gt; back pos
    == [a b c]

    r3-alpha&gt;&gt; back copied-pos
    == [b c]

Your new `copied-pos` only has parity with the original `pos` so long as no one ever uses BACK on it.  This semantic question is inherent to all kinds of functions that accept blocks that aren&#39;t at their head.  How about the low-level MAKE FUNCTION! ?

    r3-alpha&gt;&gt; spec: []
    r3-alpha&gt;&gt; body: [print &quot;one&quot; print &quot;two&quot;]

    r3-alpha&gt;&gt; test: make function! compose/only [(spec) (next next body)]

    r3-alpha&gt;&gt; test
    one  ; hey, we skipped past `print &quot;one&quot;` (?!)
    two

You&#39;ll find quirks related to this everywhere.  Ren-C has some implementation changes that make it less likely to just forget that a block encodes a position, but the questions still remain.

## How does BIND interact with Indexing?

In R3-Alpha and Rebol2, the index is ignored.  Regardless of the input position, the whole block gets the new binding:

    rebol2&gt;&gt; x: 304
    rebol2&gt;&gt; block: [x x]
    rebol2&gt;&gt; reduce block
    == [304 304]

    rebol2&gt;&gt; obj: make object! [x: 1020]
    rebol2&gt;&gt; bind next block obj
    rebol2&gt;&gt; reduce block
    == [1020 1020]

Red and Ren-C currently give back [304 1020] for the BIND case, so only the positions after are bound.

That&#39;s fine and good for BIND. But Ren-C&#39;s virtual binding gives you a new view on a block.  What happens if you step backwards in that view?

    &gt;&gt; x: 304
    &gt;&gt; block: [x x]
    &gt;&gt; obj: make object! [x: 1020]
    &gt;&gt; virtualized: in obj next block
    &gt;&gt; reduce head virtualized
    == [1020 1020]

There&#39;s nothing in the virtual binding information that says it only applies after a certain index in the block.  So if you take that step backward, you get the bindings.

It&#39;s *technically possible* to put an index position into a virtual binding...but you&#39;d also have to change the binding to remove the index after stepping down into a nested block, because the index as limit only applies at the top level.  So if instead of **[x x]** the above block had been **[[x x] [x x]]**, the you&#39;d want it to act as **[[304 304] [1020 1020]]** with the splitting at the top level, not keep splitting all the way down as **[[304 304] [304 1020]]**, thinking the &quot;start at the second item&quot; applied to the nesting too.

But even if we did that, there&#39;d be a problem with mutations.  Although virtually bound views of blocks are CONST, that&#39;s only a suggestion...you&#39;re supposed to be able to switch it to MUTABLE if you&#39;re sure you know what you&#39;re doing.  And the original block being input isn&#39;t even made CONST. 

## Does LET Make This Worse, or Just The Same?

At first I thought LET was worse, because it&#39;s an active instruction in a block to change the binding.  Meaning if you reposition in it and run it again, you get the binding twice.

But I think the main issue with that is kind of tangential.  You probably shouldn&#39;t be capturing a BLOCK! with accrued LET state in the first place; I talk about that in [Should the Evaluator Have State Besides A Block?](https://forum.rebol.info/t/pivotal-design-question-is-evaluator-state-just-a-block/1496).  It seems that&#39;s a job for FRAME!.  So really, the places that capture virtual binding state are whole blocks, where it&#39;s their stored index position that creates the problem just like any other IN OBJ at a non-head position would.

## Best Solution...Shallow COPY If You Care?

As semantically crappy as the index positioning in Rebol is...historical usage points out that quite a lot of code doesn&#39;t really wind up caring about this problem.  Most block operations are on heads of arrays...and most evaluative and binding operations never step backwards.

Offhand I feel like it would be a losing battle to try to encode a position into virtual binding.  It&#39;s probably more efficient to just have those places that have a reason for fine-grained control to make a shallow copy to prevent stepping backwards altogether.

There really are just going to be limits in a system that embraces mutability as much as Rebol historically has...the ergonomics and semantics are going to be perpetually at odds.  :-/</description>

            <p>I think people program around this feature, taking profit when only part of the info is needed in the copy, or using copy head in the other case.</p>
<p>As usual I my needs are limited so the function example had not crossed my path.</p>
