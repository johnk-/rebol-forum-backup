    <description>Hey there. I&#39;m Raghu.

I&#39;ve been coding since I was 10, mostly for the fun of it, and I still am. I&#39;m currently studying Computer Science at SRMIST.

I program mostly in Ruby, and I make HTML5 games as well.

I found Rebol through hostilefork&#39;s RebMu and Codegolf(which I am hopelessly addicted to right now). Nice to meet you all.</description>

            <p>Welcome, Raghu.</p>
<p>I hope you find something of interest in the language.  And definitely ask any questions or share any observations you have.</p>
<p>As mentioned: I'm being a bit slow in getting Rebmu back up because of "reasons"...it always seems to raise questions in the language core.  But I'll get there.</p>
<p>Learning the basics of Rebol is a prerequisite before Rebmu, though!</p>
<p>Then the Ren-C-isms push that into new territory, with a lot of new ideas and mechanics:</p>

  <blockquote>
    So there's a silly problem called "FizzBuzz" which is stated very simply: 
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
....and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

The claim is that as easy as this problem sounds, many programmers who walk into interviews have trouble with it.  On the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest" rel="nofollow noopener">c2 programming wiki</a>, someone argues for why this might be the caâ€¦
