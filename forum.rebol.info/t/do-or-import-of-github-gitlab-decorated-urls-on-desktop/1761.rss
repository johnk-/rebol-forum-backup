    <title>DO or IMPORT of GitHub/GitLab Decorated URLs on Desktop</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/do-or-import-of-github-gitlab-decorated-urls-on-desktop/1761</link>
    <description>The &quot;decorated&quot; URL for a GitHub file looks like this:

[`https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/master/scripts/unzip.reb`](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/master/scripts/unzip.reb)

And on GitLab, the &quot;decorated&quot; URLs looks like this:

[`https://gitlab.com/Zhaoshirong/rebol-chess/-/blob/master/create-board.reb`](https://gitlab.com/Zhaoshirong/rebol-chess/-/blob/master/create-board.reb)

I don&#39;t particularly like syntax highlighting (or at least not the kind done on Rebol files by these sites, which also happens to be buggy...so I turn it off on my repos).  But there are other good reasons to like using these links:

* It gives you context to see what project the file is in and to navigate around that project to see other related files.

* You can click on a line number or line number range and then give that link to someone to point to a specific line you&#39;re talking to.

* You have buttons for viewing the file history and &quot;git blame&quot; to see where changed lines came from.

* If you&#39;re an owner on the repo, you can edit it right there in the browser and commit it.

**But the HTML decorations mean these URLs give back code that the intepreter will choke on.**  So historically, if you were going to DO or IMPORT them, you would have to translate them to raw links...which lack these conveniences:

[`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metaeducation/ren-c/master/scripts/unzip.reb`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metaeducation/ren-c/master/scripts/unzip.reb)

[`https://gitlab.com/Zhaoshirong/rebol-chess/-/raw/master/create-board.reb`](https://gitlab.com/Zhaoshirong/rebol-chess/-/raw/master/create-board.reb)

*(Interestingly the GitLab raw link is actually a character shorter than the decorated one, but the GitHub raw link is longer.)*

**The web build has been willing to assume that when you say DO or IMPORT of the decorated link, what you want is the raw link.**

It wouldn&#39;t be good to redirect these URLs generally.  e.g. a READ might actually want to scrape the decorated HTML for something.  But since DO and IMPORT would just choke on the decorated URL, it&#39;s just helpful to automatically redirect them.

## Now This Feature is in the Desktop Builds Too

By request from @gchiu, I moved the function that does this to **`sys.adjust-url-for-raw`** and it is run by the core DO and IMPORT functions on URLs.

It&#39;s a generic utility that can be used by similar functions.  So CSS-DO and JS-DO use the functions as well.

If a URL is adjusted it returns it, otherwise it returns NULL.  So this is used with MAYBE:

     url: maybe sys.adjust-url-for-raw url

As a reminder of what MAYBE does...it leaves the SET-WORD! on the left unchanged if the result on the right is NULL, otherwise sets it to the new value.</description>

            <p>Great. Those decorated urls are painful no longer!</p>
<p><code>maybe</code> maybe useful!</p>
<p>So the advantage over using</p>
<p><code>Foo: any [ url ""]</code></p>
<p>It's that you don't touch any existing value held by foo</p>
