    <description>I am a French geologist, currently taking a 180 degree sharp curve in my professional life.
After ca. 30 years of practicing geology and mining exploration worldwide, I just went back to university in Bordeaux, to study computer science (https://dept-info.labri.fr/adsillh/ is the cursus I&#39;m attending).

I&#39;ve been coding with *Basic languages since 1983, with C (occasionally) since 1990, and I saw the Light when I started coding in Rebol 2 around 2001 or 2002.  I&#39;ve been working with plenty of other languages, not worth mentioning.

GNU/Linux user since 1999, exclusive GNU/Linux user since 2005, currently Debian and Devuan are giving life to most of my computers.


My Rebol experience has always been interrupted: I started with great enthusiasm and productivity; then in 2007 I wanted to subcontract the development of a tool for geologists and I wished it would be developed in Rebol: but the subcontractor didn&#39;t want, because Rebol wasn&#39;t open source software... so they (and I) switched to python for a while.  Then on 12/12/12, full of Hope, I started Rebolling again intensively, putting much hope on the Red adventure.  Today, whenever I have some quick code to do, Rebol2 comes as THE solution.

Most of what I (quite messily) coded is on my github:
https://github.com/pierrechtux/geolllibre


I feel like a perpetual Rebol beginner...</description>

</aside>
<p>Sure. Those chats are fun, but having a structured conversation, especially on long-term, is just a pain, if not impossible.<br>
I'm personally in favor of discussions lists over good old emails, I'm not too much into forums, but why not, let's see if it goes well.</p>

<p>Yes; I am discontinuing my participation on Stack Overflow (for a combination of reasons).</p>

<p>So the good news is that you have a long attention span.  <img src="https://forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:">  I've bumped you to "regular" status, so you can write about semi-off-topic things in <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/c/lounge">Lounge</a> if you like...which will be the replacement for chat.</p>

</aside>
<p>Red was something I put hopes in circa 2013, with particular interest in the idea of using the same basic code constructs in a C-like systems language as in a high-level language.  It's still a solid idea, but they have been very deep into trying to develop the cross-platform GUI aspect.  Yet they've completely skipped over plugging the foundational design holes that were so blatant and numerous in the R3-Alpha issues tracker...those issues had driven most reasonable people to lose hope, eventually.</p>
<p>Ren-C has played the long game of trying to make the language itself lock together tightly.  And I think that has been paying off, and especially right now it seems many longstanding issues are starting to click into place.</p>
<p>But due to being realistic about what can and can't be done with a skeleton crew, I've taken being the distributor of .EXE files off the table.  That day may come, but if it does, it will come <em>after</em> a online run-in-the-web as Webassembly interpreter that can frictionlessly teach and be tried by everyone.</p>
