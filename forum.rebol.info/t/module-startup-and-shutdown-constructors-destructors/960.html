          <p>I've been trying to move toward a model extensions are just <em>"modules that ship along with a DLL that have some native code, too"</em>.  This helps avoid having parallel-and-variously-incompatible versions of the same features.</p>
<p>In trying to merge the functionalities, one thing that extensions could do was that when DLLs were loaded they could run an arbitrary Startup() hook.  Then when the DLL was unloaded, it could run a Shutdown() hook.  So if you used a native API that had a paired open/close you had a moment to do both.</p>
<p>However, since a module can ship with natives, this raises the question of why the startup code can't just be run as part of the normal course of the module:</p>
<pre><code> Rebol [
     Title: {ODBC Extension}
     Type: 'Module
 ]

 call-odbc-init-c-function
 odbc-settings: make object! [...]
 ...
</code></pre>
<p>Being able to call a native living in the extension like CALL-ODBC-INIT-C-FUNCTION is every bit as good as having a special esoteric C function exposed, that the DLL loader looks up with OS APIs and calls with a magic incantation.  All that magic is already done to provide new natives to call, why not use it?</p>
<p>Plus you have more options--you can break it into multiple functions, have it get parameters from the environment, etc.  Also very important: there doesn't have to be a distinct model for error handling if something happens--such things already had to have an answer for everything else you might be calling, why make it special for the init?</p>
<h2>...but what about the shutdown?</h2>
<p>It's not totally obvious that only a module which has some of its code written as user natives would need a shutdown.  What if you have a module that opens a persistent network connection--all in usermode--and wants to do some kind of graceful signoff if it can?  Why should "extensions" be special?</p>
<p>If that generic hook were available, then native code could be run by putting it in a native ACTION! and doing it that way--just like the init.</p>
<p>This could be a SHUTDOWN: field in the module header.  Or it could be an "register-on-shutdown-callback" method that modules offer to the code running in their body (kind of the way it would offer things like EXPORT).</p>
<p>But it seems like maybe it should be more general.  Rebol doesn't have constructors and destructors...but, maybe it should?  There is now an explicit FREE which can be used to kill off an object, and only HANDLE! does cleanup...but maybe objects should be able to do something about it too.</p>
<p>For now the easiest thing to do to keep extensions going is just to make some module-specific solution and move on.  But it's worth thinking about--are there other languages in Rebol's family which have interesting constructor/destructor behavior?  Or bad behavior that would be good to know about and avoid?  Just wanted to post a note on the topic...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But it seems like maybe it should be more general. Rebol doesn't have constructors and destructors...but, maybe it should?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>So... constructors and destructors provide a commitment to what to do when you abruptly leave a "scope" where an object is declared...regardless of how you leave.</p>
<p>If you were cooking on the stove and turned on the oven, you can make a pretty good general rule that you don't want to leave the house with it on.  It doesn't matter if you get a phone call that causes you to go by way of the garage and out the garage door... or out the back door, or the front, or climb out a window.  Leaving the oven on is bad.  So if turning on the oven could instantiate a magical "turn the oven off if I forget and leave the house" gadget, such a gadget sounds good.</p>
<h2>Historically Rebol had at least one barrier...</h2>
<p>Instead of the house example...imagine we think of functions, BLOCK!s, or GROUP!s as being the kind of thing you might want to run some cleanup code for no-matter-how-you-leave-them.  There had been a particular "way of leaving" that was expensive to have every function catch.  That was exceptions--which Ren-C has called "failures".</p>
<p>Rebol (and Ren-C) use a style of coding in the C that allows it to react to things like memory allocation errors with an "exception".   This contrasts with needing to test every single series allocation (the way you would test a malloc for NULL).  These exceptions used the only method available to jump up the machine stack in C... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setjmp.h" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>setjmp</strong> and <strong>longjmp</strong></a></p>
<p>While the mechanism behind THROW was cheap, this mechanism was expensive.  And only TRAP-style (formerly named TRY-style) constructs would do it...because setting up a CPU state buffer at every stack frame boundary would be prohibitive.</p>
<h2>Stackless is removing this particular barrier</h2>
<p>By bouncing everything through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trampoline_(computing)#High-level_programming" rel="nofollow noopener">a "Trampoline"</a>, an infinite number of stack levels can be navigated with only one setjmp/longjmp.  All an exception has to do is longjmp to that.  Then stack levels (Rebol levels, not C levels...since there's only one!) can be traversed just as easily as you might bubble THROWs up for processing.  They can be examined and do whatever handling they like.</p>
<p>Given that performance is no longer a barrier to reacting to arbitrary exceptions, what might such things look like?   I don't really know.  Might just mean people are more liberal with TRAPs, if they're cheaper.  :-/</p>
<p><strong>I'm not going to go research it right now.  But pointing it out in case there are some other languages out there, where they have been more technically free and not enslaved to setjmp/longjmp...that devised cool features despite being largely GC-based.</strong></p>
<p>So that's a question on the table.  Is there something in the exception-handling world to use this as an opportunity to introduce.  All I really know on the topic is C++, and nothing immediately comes to mind besides having a way to dash off code that will run when a block exits.</p>
<p>Gist of such an idea would be something like the LATER below:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; do [
    print "Entering block"
    later [print "First exit code"]
    (
        print "Entering group"
        later [print "Second exit code"]
        print "Doing more stuff"
        later [print "Third exit code"]
        if condition [
            fail "now we fail"
        ]
        print "This only happens if condition is false"
    )
    print "This only happens if no failure, as well"
 ]
</code></pre>
<p>With condition false, you'd get:</p>
<pre><code> Entering block
 Entering group
 Doing more stuff
 This only happens if condition is false
 Third exit code  ; running in reverse order...
 Second exit code
 This only happens if no failure as well"
 First exit code
</code></pre>
<p>But with condition true and the failure, you'd get:</p>
<pre><code> Entering block
 Entering group
 Doing more stuff
 Third exit code
 Second exit code
 First exit code
 ** Error: now we fail
</code></pre>
<p>We'd imagine it not being just failures, but RETURNs and THROWs as well.  But that was possible before.  The new novelty is when it comes to "exceptions" that originate internally (vs. provoked by the FAIL native, which didn't <em>have</em> to leverage that same mechanism...but did).  These features no longer need any kind of advance payment to plan for, the way declaring a TRAP would be.  It costs no more for a block to be ready to accept an arbitrary failure (even a rug-pulled-out-from-under-a-native problem like out-of-memory that it didn't gracefully check for).</p>
<p>So a family of possibilities opens up.</p>

          <p>I noticed something in Go related to this, <a href="https://blog.golang.org/defer-panic-and-recover" rel="nofollow noopener">which is their <code>defer</code> keyword</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A  <strong>defer statement</strong>  pushes a function call onto a list. The list of saved calls is executed after the surrounding function returns. Defer is commonly used to simplify functions that perform various clean-up actions."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is quite similar to my suggestion.  Though we do not have the concept of a "currently running function", we do have a "currently running block", but that wouldn't be much use if you wrote something like:</p>
<pre><code> some-code
 if condition [
     defer [...cleanup...]
 ]
</code></pre>
<p>Running at the end of that block would be no different than just calling normally.  So that wouldn't work so well.</p>
<p>We might also be able to use things to identify frames; e.g. <strong>defer 'return [...whatever...]</strong> could get the binding out of the RETURN.  Another alternative might say that a construct that wishes to use DEFER might make a definitional defer which encodes the frame...the way that RETURN does.</p>
