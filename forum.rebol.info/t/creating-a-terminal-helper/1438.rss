    <description>Another idea I came up with that can become very useful for system administrators.
To use some applications sometimes you need to establish some connections or a certain setup before they can be started or used.

So for instance to connect to a database a ssh tunnel must be initiated and the program perhaps must be started from a shell script.

Another program will work inside a virtual environment that must be &#39;activated&#39; first and then a `cd` to the correct directory. 

There could be several other tasks that require one or more terminal windows to be used that could be centralised and managed within Ren-C.

One (other) tool could monitor the status of the different facilities that were managed before.</description>

            <p>It'd be great if we had an SSH scheme, although it doesn't seem that's the extent of your proposal?</p>

            <p>It would be that Ren-C is now run from a terminal interface but it is able to interact with that and start up multiple individual terminal instances itself.</p>

            <p>It's pretty vague. I don't see anything in there that would be a part of Ren-C. If you take just one case as an example, what would be the impact on Ren-C?</p>
