    <title>Dropping the SERIAL PORT!, for now...</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/dropping-the-serial-port-for-now/1539</link>
    <description>Carl first demonstrated a serial port interface from Rebol in Montreal, as a simple project he undertook for controlling a water heater:

@kealist then took this on to bring to R3-Alpha, and Ren-C.

In the intervening time, I learned more about the device model and ports (mostly that there wasn&#39;t much of a design there).  Experiences with trying to factor this code contributed to that knowledge.

It was an early aggressive user of the libRebol API, as non-essential code was untangled from the low-level core APIs.  So it has had an impact.

But to try and rein in the project&#39;s sprawling scope, I think it&#39;s time to say that the serial code is something that we can put aside.  Especially since we don&#39;t have a great way to test it in CI.

I won&#39;t even try to lobby @kealist to get a serial device out of the closet to spin more cycles on it...and instead point to the more interesting efforts (like [UPARSE](https://forum.rebol.info/t/introducing-uparse-the-hackable-usermode-parse/1529), or Blazor interop...)

Once a port model is implemented that can accommodate websockets and other interesting things, I&#39;m sure the serial port code could be wired up by a sufficiently-motivated-individual.

            <p>Cool.  As you have likely seen, I haven't really have the bandwidth or interest to really pick this up for a while.  Still haven't really picked up Blazor but might get into it once Maui is out and I try it for work.</p>
