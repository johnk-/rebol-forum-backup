    <title>TAG! - COMPOSE is IT (tag-specific composition)</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/tag-compose-is-it-tag-specific-composition/979</link>
    <description>There&#39;s a [new mechanism now](https://forum.rebol.info/t/quoted-arrives-formerly-known-as-lit-bit/995) for escaping GROUP!s in your code that you want preserved during a COMPOSE.  Just use an apostrophe:

     &gt;&gt; compose [(1 + 2) &#39;(1 + 2) &#39;&#39;(1 + 2)]
     == [3 (1 + 2) &#39;(1 + 2)]

If you&#39;re doing more substitutions than not, you may appreciate being able to mark the occasional GROUP! with the backslash as a &quot;do not compose&quot; indicator.

But one of the good things about templating is to be able to write most of your code normally, and then point out just the parts you want to substitute.  So if you&#39;re using so many groups that just being in a GROUP! isn&#39;t distinguishing what you want to substitute, **tagged COMPOSE** to the rescue:

    &gt;&gt; compose &lt;*&gt; [(1 + 2) (&lt;*&gt; 1 + 2) (1 + 2)]
    == [(1 + 2) 3 (1 + 2)]

The TAG! has to be given literally between the COMPOSE and the expression you want to compose.  (This is a requirement for `&lt;skip&gt;`-ability.  But you can pick any tag you like.  Currently it is matched case-sensitively.

Doubled-groups still have /ONLY semantics:

     &gt;&gt; x: [a b c]

     &gt;&gt; compose &lt;$&gt; [(1 + 2) (&lt;$&gt; reverse copy x) ((&lt;$&gt; reverse copy x)) ((1 + 2))]
     == [(1 + 2) c b a [c b a] ((1 + 2))]

You don&#39;t have to use symbols...any tag will do.  Could be a whole word with meaningful names, which might be valuable if you were doing it in several steps...where earlier phases could leave tags for later phases to compose.  You might also tag with numbers, `&lt;1&gt;` `&lt;2&gt;`...

For now this is limited to just TAG!.  It could be other inert types (like ISSUE! or TEXT!) but there doesn&#39;t seem to be a great reason to encourage that.</description>

<p>I thinks Utf-8 only is probably the future of encoding. The convergent movement of Windows and Linux Subsystem will erode the last bastions.</p>

</aside>
<p>Me too.  And if you look at the popularity of encodings <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/character_encoding">UTF-8 seems to have already won</a>.  If you are trying to build a simple system, it seems one that didn't need to support anything other than UTF-8 internally would be the future.  This is believed by <a href="http://utf8everywhere.org/">The UTF-8 Everywhere Manifesto</a>.</p>
<p>I will try and sync up the branch that only uses UTF-8... it had <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/issues/271#issuecomment-364636959">some success early in the year</a>:</p>

<p>I'm read time to time the trello board. I appreciate what you did for a better rebol.</p>
<p>I have not yet founded the time to learn Rebol. I tried but not have the whoa flash yet.</p>
<p>Maybe it's because Rebol is very different.</p>
<p>On the roadmap, for useful programs, I thinks UTF-8 is really important.</p>

<p>There’s a <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/pull/901" rel="nofollow noopener">new mechanism now </a> for escaping GROUP!s in your code that you want preserved during a COMPOSE. Just use a backslash:</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>An alternate outcome for this could be:</p>
<pre><code>== [3 '3 ''3]
</code></pre>
<p>And given the existence of the TAG!-based composition if you need it, I'm wondering if that might actually be preferable for COMPOSE.  Generic escaping of this nature is more useful than it might look--for reasons that you don't really appreciate until you start doing "hard things".</p>
<p>And as I mention, one of the nice things about working in a "template" style is having the things you intend to look as they will in the output be "as-is".  The peel-one-escape-level-off is a bit of a curveball, and tagged compose seems to achieve the goal without that curve.</p>

Maybe also the FILE! type could be enabled:</p>
