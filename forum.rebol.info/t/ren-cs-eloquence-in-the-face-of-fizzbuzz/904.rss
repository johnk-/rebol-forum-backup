    <title>Ren-C&#39;s eloquence in the face of FizzBuzz</title>
    <link>https://forum.rebol.info/t/ren-cs-eloquence-in-the-face-of-fizzbuzz/904</link>
    <description>![fizzbuzz-snap|670x499](upload://rmMvvVBnn2g0ybqB0jwY0Xy24lM.jpeg) 

So there&#39;s a silly problem called &quot;FizzBuzz&quot; which is stated very simply:

    Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
    But for multiples of three print &quot;Fizz&quot; instead of the number
    ....and for the multiples of five print &quot;Buzz&quot;.
    For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;.

The claim is that as easy as this problem sounds, many programmers who walk into interviews have trouble with it.  On the [c2 programming wiki](http://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest), someone argues for why this might be the case:

&gt; *&quot;I think Fizz-Buzz is &quot;hard&quot; for some programmers because (#1) it doesn&#39;t fit into any of the patterns that were given to them in school assignments, and (#2) **it isn&#39;t possible to directly and simply represent the necessary tests, without duplication, in just about any commonly-used modern programming language.**&quot;*

But the design of Ren-C has more than enough chops for this problem!  It&#39;s particularly elegant using a [recent change to DELIMIT](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/commit/26f94f6803df8d8e4895706a83658ddbf27bde28), including its specializations like SPACED and UNSPACED.

So how about that FizzBuzz?

    count-up n 100 [
        print [
             unspaced [
                  if n mod 3 = 0 [&quot;Fizz&quot;]
                  if n mod 5 = 0 [&quot;Buzz&quot;]
             ] else [n]
        ]
    ]

Presto...that&#39;s all it takes!!!  UNSPACED will return null if everything in its body opts out, which is the cue for the generic ELSE to run.  This brings the magic of being able to avoid duplication in the tests.  It&#39;s like every piece of problem specification corresponds to just one word in the program!

<p>SOURCE is not all that great these days, and there are reasons for that which we've discussed.</p>
<p>What it should be doing at minimum is pointing you to the <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/blob/a7e8f404c745a349c5c8df007a84feb7b005e06a/src/mezz/base-funcs.r#L756">actual source code</a>, which is rather obvious:</p>
<pre><code>count-up: redescribe [
    "Loop the body, setting a word from 1 up to the end value given"
](
    specialize :for [start: 1, bump: 1]
)
</code></pre>
<p>But under my proposal, FOR and COUNT-UP would basically just be synonyms.</p>

</aside>
<p>As we further chase down essentialism, I think the definition of FOR is going to be arity-3, and INTEGER! semantics would be COUNT-UP.  Plus @ lets us print any value, so you could write:</p>
<pre><code>for n 100 [
    print [
        if n mod 3 = 0 '#Fizz
        if n mod 5 = 0 '#Buzz
    ] else [
       print @n
    ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>But if I were making the poster today, it would probably say:</p>
<pre><code>for n 100 [
    print [
        if n mod 3 = 0 [#Fizz]
        if n mod 5 = 0 [#Buzz]
    ] else [
        print [n]
    ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>Or even clearer:</p>
<pre><code>for n [1 thru 100] [
    print [
        if n mod 3 = 0 [#Fizz]
        if n mod 5 = 0 [#Buzz]
    ] else [
        print [n]
    ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>This helps you know precisely whether it goes up-to-and-including a hundred (1 thru 100) or up-to-but-not-including a hundred (1 to 100), and that it starts at 1 and not 0.</p>

            <p>There's a new tool in the arsenal: the TOKEN! (a.k.a. "issuechar!") which does not participate in delimiting in DELIMIT-based primitives.</p>
<p>Can it help with FizzBuzz?</p>

        ] else [n]
    ]

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The UNSPACED is used as an aggregator for the ELSE to trigger on.  We can reshape it to trigger off the PRINT's output...but then we'd need another PRINT:</p>
<pre><code>count-up n 100 [
    print [
        if n mod 3 = 0 [#Fizz]
        if n mod 5 = 0 [#Buzz]
    ] else [
        print [n]
    ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>Well...it's <em>different</em>.  It trades the potential confusion of what "unspaced" means for the semantics of unspaced TOKEN! in PRINT, and repeating PRINT twice.  You lose a level of indentation--that's nice.</p>
<p>But I definitely like how PRINT can be opted out of completely...including the newline...and can telegraph its opt-out-edness to another construct.  The fact that you <em>can</em> do this with two PRINTs is interesting in its own right.</p>
<p>Just because we can, I'll point out soft-quoted branching making this lighter (at the expense of comprehensibility, but improving space/speed by removing two series allocations/nested-evaluations)</p>
<pre><code>count-up n 100 [
    print [

            <p>I knew about spaced/unspaced, had not seen it in action yet. I think unspaced here was very intuitive, like it very much, it is a true Rebol way solution. (And totally unmatched anywhere else afaik).</p>

            <p>Thanks for the remedial education. This is the kind of stuff which will be crucial important to nail-down for documentation. There are usually a few options to handle each flow of logic, due to VOID, NULL, BLANK, etc. and this influences the way the code is commonly expressed, and the language idioms. All good stuff, but I think old Rebol papered-over much of this complexity so the semantics would appear simpler. And as a result some of this important logic may have been half-baked for those who want a more complete and serious/rigorous language.</p>

<p>Yes, I must relearn some of my old ways… I still think in terms of the JOIN/REJOIN vernacular.<br>
(...)<br>
UNSPACED on the other hand, seems defined in contrast to its opposite, which is also less obvious.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I think that contrast definition will make more sense to people who learn PRINT first...realize PRINT is powered by SPACED...and then realize that UNSPACED is their alternative to what Rebol thinks of as the "natural" default.</p>
<p>Speaking of PRINT, this change involves a change to PRINT to make sure <code>print []</code> doesn't give an error, by adding a TRY:</p>
<pre><code>print: function [
    {Textually output value (evaluating elements if a block), adds newline}

    return: "null if blank input, otherwise void"
        [&lt;opt&gt; void!]
    line "Line of text, or block to run SPACED on - blank prints nothing"
        [blank! text! block!]
][
    write-stdout switch type of line [
        blank! [return null] // don't print the newline
        text! [line]
        block! [try spaced line] // blank if all opt-out, so WRITE-STDOUT is no-op
    ]
    write-stdout newline
]
</code></pre>
<p>One interesting thing here is that it shows a good reason for why cases that error on NULL from things like SPACED and UNSPACED on empty input is a good thing.  If you say:</p>
<pre><code> print unspaced [... bunch of stuff ...]
</code></pre>
<p>And UNSPACED comes back finding that all that stuff opted out and you've got nothing, which behavior do you want: <em>an empty line, or no line at all</em>?  Having NULL as the result and trigger an error helps you get in there if this case comes up, and be clear about it.</p>
<pre><code>print (unspaced [...] else [""])  ; (a) empty line if all opt-out
print &lt;| unspaced [...] else [""]  ; variant of (a) using precedence manipulation
print unspaced ["" ...]  ; variant of (a)...forces non-null UNSPACED result
print &lt;| "" unless (unspaced [...])  ; another (a), so many options!

print try unspaced [...]  ; (b) no output (including no newline) if all opt-out
</code></pre>
<p>Since ELSE completes its left hand side, you have to use a GROUP! (or an <code>&lt;-</code>) to cluster the unspaced with the else...otherwise it will interpret it as <code>(print unspaced [...]) else [""]</code>.  But a second interesting note is that PRINT now follows "blank in, null out", so having an ELSE attached to a print can now have meaning...such as in the second case!</p>
<pre><code>print try unspaced [...] else [
    ; code to run if all the unspaced content opted out, hence
    ; blank input was given to print, and no output (including
    ; no newline) was printed...this way you can react to the
    ; case of no output (if you just wanted an error, leave off
    ; the TRY!)

<p>That's because VOID!s are values (albeit quite unfriendly ones) so they doesn't count for triggering the ELSE.</p>
<p>There's quite a lot of design here, and I still feel that this language is going to be quite the code golf weapon!</p>

            <p>Yes, I must relearn some of my old ways... I still think in terms of the JOIN/REJOIN vernacular. JOIN is a nice verb which intuitively suggests its purpose. UNSPACED on the other hand, seems defined in contrast to its opposite, which is also less obvious. To a dim bulb like me, anyway. Still not a complaint; I think with more use of REN-C I won't blink at some of the nuanced changes.</p>
<p>By the way, we should ask <a class="mention" href="/u/brianotto">@BrianOtto</a> to include this script example on the Rebol home page.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Cool-- Wait, what the heck is unspaced?”.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I guess it seems fairly sensible to to me...especially when people get introduced to it as <strong>print unspaced [...]</strong>.  If that's how you learn it, you then think of being able to lift out the unspacing behavior you used when you needed it into a function.  And you can say <strong>print spaced [...]</strong> too, though that's <em>usually</em> redundant.</p>
<p>Though if it were just JOIN it might <em>appear</em> clearer in this particular case, I think reserving JOIN for something else makes sense.  Trying to use a generic series-joining operator for string production is problematic, as <a href="https://forum.rebol.info/t/rejoin-ugliness-and-the-usefulness-of-tests/248">@Brett explains in detail</a>.</p>
<p>But it's a good point that presenting FizzBuzz probably needs a little lead-in to explain UNSPACED to the uninitiated, to make absorption smoother.</p>

            <p>Love it. FizzBuzz is indeed a neat example of a language challenge.<br>
I'm still inexperienced with unspaced, so its use here seems like a fancy trick but not an intuitive function name.<br>
This is in no way a complaint <img src="//forum.rebol.info/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=7" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> , I'm just thinking that someone coming from another language might see this short eloquent example but wonder "Cool-- Wait, what the heck is unspaced?".</p>

<p>But the design of Ren-C has the chops for this problem! It has them even moreso with a <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/commit/26f94f6803df8d8e4895706a83658ddbf27bde28">change to DELIMIT</a> and hence its specializations like SPACED and UNSPACED.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I had been considering the change to DELIMIT for a while, but seeing just what a win for this example put it over the top.</p>
<p>One might have tried and done this from the outside, for instance with a CHAIN:</p>
<pre><code>unspaced*: chain [:unspaced | function [x] [if x &lt;&gt; "" [x]]]
</code></pre>
<p>That makes a variant of the old UNSPACED which pipes its output into a function that uses an IF test against empty string…and if it  <em>is</em>  the empty string the test fails and it returns null, as all failed conditionals do.</p>
<p>While that works (and is impressive in its own right), it isn't quite as useful.  The problem is that this would mean that you'd wind up with a null even if you had purposely put empty strings into your data.  But I think that makes a really good way to opt out of the nullification:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; unspaced [null null]
; null

&gt;&gt; unspaced ["" null]
== ""
</code></pre>
<p>Making that distinction is something DELIMIT has to do in its implementation, or you wind up rewriting DELIMIT!</p>
<h3>The change to DELIMIT was too compelling to not do!</h3>
<p>...because <em>the whole point of the system design is to get bragging rights on problems like FizzBuzz</em>.</p>
<p>I think this is impressive, but it's really very much the tip of the iceberg of what's going on.</p>

<p>So there's a silly problem called "FizzBuzz" which is stated very simply:</p>
<pre><code>Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number
....and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
</code></pre>
<p>The claim is that as easy as this problem sounds, many programmers who walk into interviews have trouble with it.  On the <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest">c2 programming wiki</a>, someone argues for why this might be the case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"I think Fizz-Buzz is "hard" for some programmers because (<span class="hashtag">#1</span>) it doesn't fit into any of the patterns that were given to them in school assignments, and (<span class="hashtag">#2</span>) <strong>it isn't possible to directly and simply represent the necessary tests, without duplication, in just about any commonly-used modern programming language.</strong>"</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the design of Ren-C has more than enough chops for this problem!  It's particularly elegant using a <a href="https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c/commit/26f94f6803df8d8e4895706a83658ddbf27bde28">recent change to DELIMIT</a>, including its specializations like SPACED and UNSPACED.</p>
<p>So how about that FizzBuzz?</p>
<pre><code>count-up n 100 [
    print [
         unspaced [
              if n mod 3 = 0 ["Fizz"]
              if n mod 5 = 0 ["Buzz"]
         ] else [n]
    ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>Presto...that's all it takes!!!  UNSPACED will return null if everything in its body opts out, which is the cue for the generic ELSE to run.  This brings the magic of being able to avoid duplication in the tests.  It's like every piece of problem specification corresponds to just one word in the program!</p>
