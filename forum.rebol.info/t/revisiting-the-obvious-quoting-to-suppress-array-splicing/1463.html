<div class="title">
<div class="quote-controls"></div>
<img alt="" width="20" height="20" src="https://forum.rebol.info/user_avatar/forum.rebol.info/ingohohmann/40/195_2.png" class="avatar"><a href="../make-splicing-by-default-only-apply-when-appending-a-block/226/7.html">Make Splicing by default only apply when appending a BLOCK!</a>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Well these days to splice or not to splice could be controlled with quoted-, get-, set- variants.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I pointed out that unfortunately this wouldn't have the desired behavior at the callsites... because the evaluation of the parameter would strip the quote off before APPEND saw it:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; '[d e]
== [d e]

&gt;&gt; append [a b c] '[d e]
== [a b c d e]
</code></pre>
<p>For APPEND to "see the tick", it would have to change its parameter convention to take its argument literally...which is not desirable...or you have to use a function that adds it:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; quote [d e]
== '[d e]

&gt;&gt; append [a b c] quote [d e]
== [a b c [d e]]
</code></pre>
<h2>You Could Ask: "So What?"</h2>
<p>We've been expressing a willingness to use an ONLY operator to signal an intent to add things "as is":</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; only [d e]
== [[d e]]

&gt;&gt; append [a b c] only [d e] 
== [a b c [d e]]
</code></pre>
<p>But optimizing that to an extreme would be hard, and weird.  The more I look at it, the more reluctant I am to push the optimizations to the point of not using a series node.  e.g. the "one series node" optimization is about as far as I may feel comfortable pushing ONLY.</p>
<p>On the other hand...generic quoting is already written, and systemically optimized, even to multiple levels (up to 3)...and does no allocations.  And QUOTE will be something users are already familiar with.</p>
<p>Plus, you at least have the option when writing expert-optimized code to use the learnable idiom of two ticks when you have a literal:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; append [a b c] ''[d e]
== [a b c [d e]]
</code></pre>
<h2>Ok, But, It Makes QUOTED! Another Interfered-With Type <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowning.png%3Fv=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:">
</h2>
<p>Let's say you're running through a block of items that contains quoted things and want to append them somewhere...you've now got another type that APPEND chooses to muck with if you don't say /ONLY or QUOTE:</p>
<pre><code>data1: [1 2 &lt;skipme&gt; x y 'z]
data2: []

for-each item data1 [
    if not tag? item [
        append data2 item
    ]
]

&gt;&gt; data2
== [1 2 x y z]  ; oops, 'z got turned into plain z
</code></pre>
<p>Still.. <em>what happened to <strong>'z</strong> would have just as easily happened to <strong>[z]</strong>.</em>  So how much worse is losing of a level of quote than losing the containership of a block?</p>
<p>Rebol2 messed with your BLOCK!s, GROUP!s and ANY-PATH!s if you forgot to say /ONLY.  Now it would mess with your BLOCK!s and your QUOTED!s.</p>
<p><strong>I'm not in love with this aspect...but just pointing out that there's been no perfect answer to the problem, yet.</strong>  So having an imperfect property doesn't rule something out automatically.</p>
<h2>Main Point: Stepping Back From The Abyss of Optimization...</h2>
<p>Using the sunk cost of work on QUOTED! vs. making a "magic" kind of block came to me while thinking about something related.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a function that takes actions to run, and you want to pass that something that just returns a constant value.</p>
<p>One way to do this today is to make a specialization of the IDENTITY function:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; three: specialize :identity [value: 3]

&gt;&gt; type of :three
== #[action!]

&gt;&gt; three
== 3
</code></pre>
<p>But it feels a shame for such an action to take up more space and load the GC than just the simple number 3 would take.  So we can imagine an overlaying cell formats, and how to "lie" about being an ACTION! when the cell is really an INTEGER!.</p>
<p><em>But oh what a tangled web we weave...</em> trying to engineer this deception has so many problems it becomes hard to count them all.  You can set meta information on actions, but this integer-action has no place to put it.  If you convert it to a real ACTION! on demand, then each such conversion would get a new identity...putting the inefficiencies aside, that's a semantic problem because actions are expected to have individual identities, and these just don't.</p>
<p><strong>It would be much simpler if you had written the routine that was willing to take an action to also take a QUOTED!</strong>.</p>
<p>This makes a good argument for why QUOTED!s should answer to the same questions that an action might...just minus that one lie of "I am an action!"</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt; a: func [] [return just x]
&gt;&gt; q: just 'x

&gt;&gt; do :a
== x

&gt;&gt; do :q  ; colon not needed, but shows same flow as when using an action
== x

&gt;&gt; parameters of :a
== []

&gt;&gt; parameters of :q
== []
</code></pre>
<p>I guess the point I'm trying to make is that while it might seem a bit dissatisfying to have to handle a QUOTED! or an ACTION!, it seems that the places where you would have actual trouble with it is anywhere such methods don't make sense...and those points are exactly where a "fake" optimized action would break down.</p>
<p>This line of thinking took me to where I thought that making an optimized BLOCK! that doesn't have the implementation character of a BLOCK! (e.g. a series node) is a mistake in a similar vein.  If you demand this particular axis of efficiency, you should use the systemic mechanism of a QUOTED! to get it...or say it's not worth it.</p>
<h2>So Does Mucking Up QUOTED!s Beat the /ONLY Option?</h2>
<p>I'm not feeling convinced.</p>
<p>The only thing I think I've convinced myself of is that the fake no-node block trick I was considering is bad for the health of the system.  We are making 1-element blocks somewhat efficiently, but they're not free.  So I wanted to write up the thinking behind that...and share the rest in case it triggered any brainstorms.</p>
